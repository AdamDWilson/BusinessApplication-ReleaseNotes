#  Microsoft Flow




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft is modernizing business processes across productivity, CRM, and ERP
applications, which makes it easier for every business to transform how people
work. Microsoft Flow, the Microsoft workflow and business process management
platform, is core to the success of this mission. It's the connective glue
that’s used by users and app developers alike for digital transformation, no
matter what application they’re using. Microsoft Flow, together with PowerApps and Power
BI, makes up the Business application platform.
