We’re thrilled to announce our Spring ’18 release, which delivers significant
investments designed to help you transform your business.

These new services and capabilities are available starting in April 2018.

We’ve made tremendous progress:

-   **Unifying our business applications** across marketing, sales, service,
    operations, finance, talent, and retail into a comprehensive family of
    capabilities that spans the entire business process landscape – so you can
    solve specific business problems with applications that work seamlessly
    together.

-   **Ensuring you gain synergistic benefit from your other Microsoft
    investments** by enriching Dynamics 365 with deeper integrations with
    Microsoft Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, Stream, Azure, and LinkedIn. We’ve
    enhanced Dynamics 365 with data and signal from Office 365 and Bing. We’ve
    also made Dynamics 365 more intelligent by employing decades of AI work
    pioneered by Microsoft Research.

-   **Advancing the platform beneath Dynamics 365** – the same platform beneath
    Office 365 – to combine Power BI, PowerApps, Microsoft Flow, Microsoft
    Stream, the Common Data Service for Apps, and the Common Data Service for
    Analytics into an unmatched palette of tools to extend, customize, and
    integrate Dynamics 365 and Office 365 into your environment. These
    experiences are powered by insights and intelligence from data across
    hundreds of business systems with built‑in connectivity to the platform, and
    with rich audio‑visual media that integrates tightly into the business
    applications people use daily.

We’ve done this work to help you – our partners, customers, and users – drive
the digital transformation of your business on your terms.

We’re looking forward to engaging with you as you put these new services and
capabilities to work, and we’re eager to hear your feedback as you dig into the
Spring ’18 release.
