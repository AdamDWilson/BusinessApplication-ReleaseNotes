# Social Insights from Social Engagement

The Social Insights control from Microsoft Social Engagement enables you to bring social media data directly into dashboards and entity forms in Dynamics 365 apps. The easy-to-understand widgets provide insights to help you understand what customers or prospects are saying about your products, brands, and services. Work with the Social Insights controls to specify what social data you want to see, and in what form you want the data presented. Choose from graphs, charts, or other visual representations to see interesting, useful, and easy-to-follow information.

The Social Insights widgets on forms and dashboards provide convenient access to social data right where you work. At any time, you can click on any widget to go to the Social Engagement site to drill down and explore the data further.

The Social Insights control comes with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement subscriptions. An administrator needs to [configure the connection to Social Engagement and add the Social Insights controls to system dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/social-engagement/integrate-social-engagement-dynamics-365).

Social Insights is also supported for apps that are built on the [Unified Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/about-unified-interface) framework.
