# Spring ’18 summary of what’s new in Retail




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

## April ’18 - General Availability

- [CDX and data management](cdx-data-management.md) - Provides improved offline capabilities to ensure that point of sale terminals continue to function during updates or internet disconnects.
- [Deployment and servicing](deployment-servicing.md) - Provides resource governance between transactional and back-office workloads to ensure that long-running batch processes don't affect transactional system performance, and that peak store traffic doesn't impede back office operations.
- [End-of-day processing](end-day-processing.md) - Enhancements include improved statement posting performance, the addition of rollback and recovery to prevent data corruption, and enhanced in-app diagnostics that show status, errors, and logs.
- [Globalization: Retail localization for India](globalization-retail-localization-india.md) - Calculation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) and value-added tax (VAT) in POS is implemented.
- [Globalization: Certified cash registers for France](globalization-certified-cash-registers-france.md) - New capabilities fulfill the requirements for NF525. The Retail solution is certified by an accredited body.
- [Payments](payments.md) - Improved tolerance when connecting to payment providers over unreliable networks. There is also a stateless payment stack to prevent payment failures from crashing the point of sale app, and improved extensibility for payment scenarios at the point of sale.
- [Extensibility (HQ, POS, CRT)](extensibility-hq-pos-crt.md) - New extension points simplify the customization model, reduce the lines of code that need to be written by customers and partners, and reduce the effort required to upgrade.
- [Monitoring and alerting](monitoring-alerting.md) - Added granularity in monitoring the health of specific user operations.
