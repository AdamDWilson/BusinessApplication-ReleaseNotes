#  PowerApps




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

PowerApps is the high-productivity application development platform from
Microsoft. In this release, we’re combining the richness of Dynamics 365 with
the agility of PowerApps to create a single unified platform. The PowerApps
platform is now the platform that the Dynamics 365 for Sales, Service,
Marketing, and Talent applications are natively built on. This release also
includes major advancements to the Common Data Service for Apps (the data
platform that comes with PowerApps) and client UX creation tools. These new
capabilities are backward-compatible with the Dynamics 365 platform (frequently
called the xRM platform), which means that Dynamics 365 customizers and partners
can use already-acquired skills to create apps with PowerApps.



PowerApps is also tightly integrated with Office 365. You can use the same set
of tools to customize and extend an increasing number of Office 365 apps, and
build standalone business applications connected to more than 200 data sources.
You can now build two types of applications with PowerApps: model‑driven apps
and canvas apps.
