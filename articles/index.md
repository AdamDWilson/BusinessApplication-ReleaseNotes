# Welcome to the Business Applications Release notes

These release notes describe new services and capabilities in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 business applications and our application platform products, such as Microsoft PowerApps and PowerBI.

Plus, to help you plan for upcoming capabilities, the release notes include a list of capabilities that are currently in development, but not yet assigned a release date.  

We know how important these release notes are to your organization for planning a successful update. We want to know what works and what doesn’t. Let us know your thoughts by sending email to [releasenotes@microsoft.com](mailto:releasenotes@microsoft.com). We’ll use your feedback to improve our content.

> [!NOTE]
> The release notes are available as a PDF. [Download the Spring '18 release notes](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=870424).
