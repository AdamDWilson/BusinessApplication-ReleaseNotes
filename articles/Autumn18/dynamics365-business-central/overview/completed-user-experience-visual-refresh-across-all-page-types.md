### Completed user experience visual refresh across all page types 

In the Spring 2018 release, Business Central received a new and refreshed user
experience. While the refresh was across many major parts of the application,
there were some areas that were left untouched. With the Fall 2018 update, the
user experience refresh is complete across the entire application. All pages,
including card pages (e.g. Customer card) have been updated with a new refreshed
and appropriately reimagined user experience. The new user experience now brings
its benefits of increased screen estate, better data visibility and easier
navigation to the entire application.
