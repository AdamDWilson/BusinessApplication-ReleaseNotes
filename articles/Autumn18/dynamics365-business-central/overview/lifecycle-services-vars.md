### Lifecycle Services for VARs

Dynamics 365 Business Central VARs receive the ability to build, upload, manage,
deploy, upgrade and troubleshoot their customizations and ISV add-ons they use
through Lifecycle Services (LCS). In addition to lifecycle management, LCS will
also enable VARs to manage their engagement with customers and ISVs whose
solutions they may be using in customer deployments.
