### Dynamics 365 Business Central available on premises

While Business Central is a cloud-first service, customers that need to run
their workloads on premises or on the intelligent edge connected to the cloud
can do so. With Business Central, once the customer signs up for the service in
the cloud, they have the option to deploy it locally to their own choice of
hardware. While they are running on their own hardware, the customer will have a
tenant in the cloud, and the data from the customer’s hardware will be
replicated to the cloud for Intelligent Cloud scenarios. At all times, the
customer is informed of their “Cloud Ready” status, so when they’re ready to
transition to the cloud completely, it’s a simple step.

Inversely, if the customer decides to take their cloud workload temporarily or
permanently from the cloud to on-premises, they will be able to do so. The
customer data is always uploaded to the cloud from on-premises (customers can
opt out if desired), to bring the intelligent cloud capabilities to the Business
Central deployments on the intelligent edge. Business Central will be licensed
through CSP, at a same price, regardless where the customer (through a partner)
deploys their solution.
