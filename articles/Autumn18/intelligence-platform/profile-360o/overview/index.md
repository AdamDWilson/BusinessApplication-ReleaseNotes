#  Overview


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

As companies and industries around the world go through digital transformation,
and as competition becomes progressively fiercer, it is critical for every
company to become truly data driven, gaining insights from signals related to
their customers, employees, and products. Microsoft has unique, differentiated
datasets, which we can join with data to enrich it with additional insights
(e.g. adding demographic and brand affinity data to an existing customer
profile). Customers who store data in the Common Data Service for Analytics not
only benefit from our application and data services but can also benefit from
the enhancement of their profile data across core business entities.

Today we are announcing the public preview of Profile 360Â°, a new capability
within Power BI which enables you to combine signals related to any business
entity in the Common Data Service for Analytics, leveraging artificial
intelligence & matching algorithms to create unified master records, which can
then be enriched with Microsoft data from Bing and Office 365.
