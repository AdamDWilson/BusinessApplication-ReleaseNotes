#  SQL Server Reporting Services Remote Configuration


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Manually defining SQL Server Reporting Services connection details is not
trivial for most business users. With this feature, IT Administrators who manage
mobile devices in the organization, or Power BI administrators who manage Power
BI apps, will be able to define SQL Server Reporting Services configurations in
their EMM organizational tool. This configuration includes SQL Server Reporting
Services Server Name, URL, and username. These details will be pushed to the
mobile device to set the SQL Server Reporting Services configuration
automatically. The mobile user will only be prompted to provide a password.
