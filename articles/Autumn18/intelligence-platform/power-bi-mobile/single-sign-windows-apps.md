#  Single Sign-On for Windows apps 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Users working on Windows devices, are asked to logon to the device, and provide
their credentials. In this scenario, Power BI can be configured to take the user
credentials from the OS and use them to login to Power BI to provide a seamless
experience for business users. This capability is also useful for large screen
devices, located in conference rooms and collaboration areas and will not
require users using the device to login again.
