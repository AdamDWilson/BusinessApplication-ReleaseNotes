#  Overview


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

With the Power BI Report Server, customers can meet their unique governance and
deployment requirements while enjoying modern Power BI reports. In the Fall 2018
update to Power BI Report Server, customers benefit from many of the features
released in Power BI Desktop over the previous months, including drill through
on measures, and conditional formatting based on another column. In addition,
the Power BI Report Server now supports additional capabilities to address
common enterprise reporting scenarios such as row level security to restrict the
data seen by each user and compartmentalize sensitive information within the
organization. With Export to Excel, users can analyze data on their own.
