#  Apply and change themes


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

With report themes you can apply a color theme to your entire report, such as
corporate colors, or seasonal coloring. When you apply a report theme, all
visuals in your report use the colors from your selected theme.

Applying a report theme requires a JSON file which you can import into the Power
BI Desktop and apply to your report. The JSON file structure, and the process of
importing it is quick and easy. This new capability allows applications to call
an API to apply and change themes on a session level for embedded objects.
