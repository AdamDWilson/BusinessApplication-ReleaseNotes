#  Multi-region support 


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI Embedded customers can purchase capacity in multiple regions, including
regions other than the region where their Power BI home tenant resides. This
capability gives customers control of where data resides, since they can assign
workspaces and all the data in the workspace to be in a specific region,
ensuring the data remains inside the region.
