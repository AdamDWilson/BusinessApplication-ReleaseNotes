#  New metrics for Azure load monitoring




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Four new metrics were added to monitor Power BI Embedded resource consumption
and trigger actions when configurable thresholds are exceeded.:

路 Memory consumption

路 Memory Thrashing

路 CPU spikes over 80%

路 Direct Query utilization

Developers can use Azure to define thresholds to trigger specific actions using
Alerts, such as automatic scale-up of the resource whenever a specific monitor
crosses a defined threshold.
