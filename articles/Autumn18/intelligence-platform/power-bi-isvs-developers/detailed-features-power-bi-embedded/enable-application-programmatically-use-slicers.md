#  Enable an application to programmatically use slicers




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Slicers API will give the application control, throughout the session, of
the slicers the user interacts with. The API will be like the Filters API so
that it will be easy and intuitive for the developer. The supported capabilities
are:

-   Get Slicers value

-   Set Slicers value on load

-   Set Slicers value during the session

-   Get the value of the userâ€™s applied slicer
