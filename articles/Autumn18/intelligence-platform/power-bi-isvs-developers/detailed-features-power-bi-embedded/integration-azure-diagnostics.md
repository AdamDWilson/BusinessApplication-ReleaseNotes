#  Integration with Azure Diagnostics 




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Azure Diagnostics is the capability within Azure that enables the collection of
diagnostic data on a deployed application. The Azure diagnostics extension can
transfer this data to an Azure storage account or send it to services like
Application Insights. The data can be used for debugging and troubleshooting,
measuring performance, monitoring resource usage, traffic analysis and capacity
planning, and auditing. We are integrating Power BI Embedded with Azure
Diagnostics to enable diagnostics of Power BI Embedded along with other Azure
resources used by the application.
