#  Improved Refresh APIs




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Adding API support for scheduled refresh and incremental refresh, so it can work
in an analogous way as the existing 'Refresh' API. Developers will be able to
activate an API that will initiate refresh on a dataset immediately. For the new
API, the refresh will be incremental rather than refreshing the entire dataset.
