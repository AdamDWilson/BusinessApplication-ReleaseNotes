#  Enable developers to troubleshoot


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

In the Fall release we are giving Power BI Embedded developers a way to
troubleshoot by logging detailed error events to the console on demand, or to
their telemetry. The improved experience includes better error messages,
indicating root cause, and better documentation explaining the error codes and
when there is a need to issue a support ticket.
