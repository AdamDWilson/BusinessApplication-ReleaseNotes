#  Automatic end to end deployment of PBI Embedded solutions




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

There are multiple deployment scenarios for applications. Two examples are ISVs
that support multiple tenants, and ISVs that develop an application and deploy
it separately for each of their customers. These new deployment capabilities
will simplify the deployment process and the application lifecycle management.
The main capability is the ability to copy content between different tenants
which also enables development processes with pre-production and production
environments on separate tenants.
