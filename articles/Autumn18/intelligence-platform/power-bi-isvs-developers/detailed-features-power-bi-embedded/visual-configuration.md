#  Visual configuration




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

The visual is an integrated part of the application. As such, we are enabling
the application to control which visual functionality and experiences the
end-user will be exposed to. The default behavior is to expose all the Power BI
capabilities:

路 Show in Focus mode

路 Export data

路 Show data

路 Spotlight

The application will have the control to enable all or some of the capabilities,
as well as decide whether to show the upper bar on the visual. We also allow
these settings to be configured for each visual separately.
