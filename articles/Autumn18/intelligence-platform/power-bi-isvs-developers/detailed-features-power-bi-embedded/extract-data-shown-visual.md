#  Extract the data shown in a visual




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

While a visual is embedded within an application, the user of that application
can interact with the visual by setting filters or cross referencing from other
visuals in the report. As part of making analytics an integrated part of the
application and the application business logic, we will enable applications to
extract the data that is shown in the visual. Interaction with the visual
results in meaningful data which the user wants to act on. This will enable the
application to get this data and trigger application business logic based on the
data that is meaningful for the application user in this context.
