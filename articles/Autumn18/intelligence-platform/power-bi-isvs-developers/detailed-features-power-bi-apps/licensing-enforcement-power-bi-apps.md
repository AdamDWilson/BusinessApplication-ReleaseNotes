#  Licensing enforcement for Power BI Apps




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

The ability to monetize Power BI Apps is one of the main incentives to develop
and offer those applications to the market. The licensing, set by the
application’s developers, must be enforced by the platform to avoid abuse and
revenue loss. Licensing enforcement is based on users registered and managed in
Azure Active Directory as the application’s users.
