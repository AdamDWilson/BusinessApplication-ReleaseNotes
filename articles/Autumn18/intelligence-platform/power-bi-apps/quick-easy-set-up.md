#  Quick and easy to set up


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI Apps are available to users for install via AppSource. A guided setup
experience is provided to help users get set up quickly with minimal friction.
After providing a few configuration settings (e.g. credentials) users are
redirected to their Power BI service account where reports for their app are
readily available. A notification is sent to the users letting them know when
their data is available, and their app is ready for use.
