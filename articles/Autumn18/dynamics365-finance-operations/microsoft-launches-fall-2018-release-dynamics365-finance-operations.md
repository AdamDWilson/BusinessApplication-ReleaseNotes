Microsoft launches the Fall 2018 release of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Redmond, WA – October 1, 2018** – Companies of all sizes are coming to the
realization that the essence of their business depends on the success (or
failure) of the products and services they offer to their customers and the only
way to ensure success is through digital transformation. Microsoft is announcing
the latest update available for customers who are on the digital transformation
journey to transform products and services. Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance
and Operations has delivered a service focusing on empowering users with
fundamental business productivity enhancements, bringing intelligence and
insights to all users, while showcasing scenarios spanning Microsoft
technologies.

**Focus on Fundamentals**

The fall release continues to expand supportability efforts for the community.
This allows the community to build extensible solutions integrated with the
Finance and Operations application. Customers experience zero downtime since
Microsoft manages the continuous updates of the platform and financial reporting
with no costly upgrades required. Customers can opt for a fully data- resident
online Dynamics 365 F&O subscription. All customer data and code will be
contained in the data region of their choice. Data residency will be made
available in the following data regions: Europe, Canada, UK and Australia.

-   **Improving the business user experience**: Business users see fundamental
    day-to-day productivity gains by being able to save and share optimized
    views of data, group data based on a list of values, filter by date, and
    allow for Excel-like filtering by column headers. Business users want
    control of their experience. Personalization capabilities empower them to
    add/remove columns from a grid and hide any field to simplify and increase
    the speed of data entry.

-   **Increasing productivity, control, and auditability:** Customers increase
    the speed and accuracy of their work with data entry enhancements.
    Additional controls for new master data provide companies insight into and
    tracking of their key business processes. Customers gain improved reporting,
    auditability, and drill-back with additional subledger data translated in
    multiple currencies.

-   **Extending global coverage**: Global or regional customers with offices in
    United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Russia can start using Finance and
    Operations; this release supports regulatory requirements for these
    countries. NOTE: Russia localization is available for on-premises
    deployments only. In the fall release, we also expanded our regulatory
    retail coverage to six Eastern European countries (Czech Republic, Estonia,
    Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland), delivered a Fiscal Printer
    Integration sample for Italy, and provided upgrade and N-1 support for the
    Indian Retail localization. We also made several enhancements in our global
    electronic reporting (GER) and global tax engines (GTE) to provide a better
    regulatory feature configurability experience for power users.

**Intelligence and insights**

Bringing intelligence and insights to the forefront for business users increases
efficiencies and productivity for the organization. Microsoft has launched
several new experiences which can stand alone or work better together with
Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.

-   **Product 360:** Bringing visibility into the product lifecycle.
    Manufacturers are now armed with product-level visibility, across every
    touch-point, with internal and external signals. The entire product
    eco-system will be empowered by sharing product information to facilitate
    collaboration between all stakeholders for continuous product improvements.
    Continuously improved products lead to a more delightful customer
    experience, driving further customer loyalty and revenue.

-   **Financial Insights:** Organizations often find it challenging to predict
    when a customer will pay their invoices. This lack of insight leads to less
    accurate cash flow forecasts, inefficient collection processes, and/or
    orders being released to customers who may pose a credit risk. Financial
    insights uses machine learning to predict when an invoice will be paid. It
    also provides optimization strategies that can be tailored to maximize the
    probability of customers paying on time.

-   **Connected Factory:** Providing our users the ability to connect to shop
    floor machines using Azure IoT platform and Dynamics 365 Finance &
    Operations manufacturing functionality giving them the option to monitor the
    health and state of the resources and take business actions in case of any
    anomalies in the shop floor resources.

**Better together**

Microsoft is improving the digital workspace by streamlining the power and
experiences of business applications, allowing business users to be more
efficient while navigating across applications.

-   **Sales & Service Integrations**: Seamless integrations leveraging the CDS
    data integrator support scenarios for Customer Service and Dynamics 365 for
    Finance and Operations. These integrations continue to bring new experiences
    such as project-based travel expenses, work breakdown structure support to
    manage planning, and billing to support project managers. Field technicians
    using Field Service have insight to the inventory information stored in
    Finance and Operations, allowing them to update inventory levels and
    complete material transfer. In addition, companies installing or servicing
    sold goods will benefit from visibility to the full sales and service
    process.

-   **Dynamics 365 for Talent integration**: The CDS data integrator provides
    two-way integration for employees who are using Dynamics 365 for Finance and
    Operations and Dynamics 365 for Talent. Employees will experience a seamless
    transition as data is shared between these systems.

-   **Regulatory Configuration Service:** The regulatory configuration tool
    (known as Electronic Reporting) is now an independent service. This service
    allows partners and customers using multiple versions of Finance and
    Operations and earlier Dynamics AX versions (such as Microsoft Dynamics AX
    2012 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, for India only) to configure regulatory
    features only once and use one common service for various versions. The
    regulatory configuration service targets a no-code programming approach,
    allowing power users to configure frequently-changed legal requirements for
    regulatory reports, e-invoices, payment formats and tax rules, rather than
    writing code in multiple applications. Regulatory configuration service is
    the first component of Regulatory Services, providing regulatory
    functionality that can be integrated with any business application. This
    service allows developers building applications to focus on their core
    functionality rather than worrying about meeting the increasing number of
    legal requirements around the globe.
