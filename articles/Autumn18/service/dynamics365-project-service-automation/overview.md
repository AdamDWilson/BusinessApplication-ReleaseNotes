**Dynamics 365 for Project Service focus on customer-driven enhancements**  
 

REDMOND, WA October 31, 2018 

The latest release of Project Service reflects our commitment to address
customer feedback through a cadence of continuous service improvements. Since
initial release in 2016, Project Service evolved rapidly to uptake Unified
Resource Scheduling, add Microsoft Project and Exchange integration, and adopt
the new Universal Client interface. While we made these architectural and user
interface investments, a growing portfolio of enterprise and midsized customers
went live on the service and delivered invaluable feedback on functional gaps
and incomplete customer scenarios. With the Fall '18 release, we rebalanced to
focus squarely on practical and tactical functional and usability improvements
that live and soon-to-be live customers have requested. As well, from a
go-forward perspective, we commit now to maintain a balance between sustaining
improvements and innovations in each future release.
