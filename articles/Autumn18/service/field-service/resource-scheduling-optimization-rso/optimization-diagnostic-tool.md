#  Optimization Diagnostic Tool 


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

The goal of this feature is to help RSO administrators understand how RSO’s
optimization works behind-the-scenes by providing an analytical report,
detailing which resources weren’t booked because of a corresponding constraint
or optimization rule.
