#  Secure Messaging


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

*This is a P0 ask from Department of Veteran Affairs for the Omni Channel
feature work*

Secure Messaging provides authenticated portal users to securely communicate
with employees of an organization.

*VA/ health care sector use case: Secure messaging can play a key role in
improving patient access to health care providers. It can be used to promote
care coordination between visits, handle routine health questions, address
patient profile update requests, handle routine nonclinical tasks such as
medication refills, referrals etc.*

*Though VA is the \#1 driver behind this ask and is from health care industry we
also see huge application of this feature in other industries like banking where
secure messaging plays a key role in customer service, hence the feature will be
developed to serve multiple industry segments in need of secure messaging
capability that is integrated with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement.*

Key aspects of this feature are:

-   Asynchronous messaging on portals for authenticated portal users

-   Inbox experience for customer

-   Notifications for customer (New Message)

-   Consistent and contextual experience for agents via omnichannel framework

-   Secure â€“ encrypted in transit, encryption at rest
