#  Customer Service (Omni-channel) release notes


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

While the omni-channel gaps of Chat and Messaging are coming up in the majority
of deals, the sequencing of the release plan below was put together specifically
to address the key asks from our largest customer, Department of Veteran Affairs
(VA). To deliver this on the proposed timelines, We have the following key
dependencies and any slips in their deliverables will cause our timelines to
slip.

1.  Microsoft Teams (Office) needs to deliver API enhancements by July, for us
    to take a dependency on their messaging Infrastructure for Live Chat

2.  Dependencies on CDS -A team for Analytics infrastructure (Agent/Supervisor
    Dashboards)

3.  Multi-session console Application capabilities on UCI Infrastructure.
    (mitigated with USD in Fall, but needed in Feb’19)
