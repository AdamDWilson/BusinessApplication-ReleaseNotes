#  Intelligent Action




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Actions based on intelligence derived out of data helps customer service
organization in reducing the cost of operations as well improving the quality of
customer engagement.



##### Automated quality monitoring



Today customer service organizations ensure quality of their customer engagement
sessions by manually listening or reading the transcripts of a few sampled
sessions. The monitoring is done to ensure the CSRs are following the best
practices, are not using banned phrases and are not rude to customers.
Compliance to standards such as PCI for financial segment requires organizations
to ensure CSRs do not ask for SSN or credit card PIN information. By leveraging
[Text Analytics

and [Bing Speech
APIs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/speech/)
organization can improve the quality of their CSRs’ conversation and compliance
to standards analyzing 100 % of the conversations rather than a few samples.
