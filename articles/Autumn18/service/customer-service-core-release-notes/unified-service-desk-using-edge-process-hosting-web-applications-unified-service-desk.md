#  Unified Service Desk: Using Edge Process for hosting web applications in Unified Service Desk




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Key Dependency on Edge Browser team to deliver APIs in Windows 10 RS5. This
dependency has been acknowledged as an ask from other First party applications
and ISVs(Adobe) and has been committed.

Unified Service Desk will allow the customers to host the web applications,
including CRM web client and Unified Interface pages, using the Edge process. As
IE approaches end of life, this capability, available only to Windows 10 RS5
customers, will provide an alternative to the internet explorer which is the
only method available today to host web applications in USD. It will also
address the reliability and performance issues that can be attributed to
internet explorer, for example the CRM pages in Unified Client are known to load
50% faster in Edge as compared to IE.
