#  Reliability Attainment across scenarios (Goal: 99.99%)




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

For all scenarios, the metric we are tracking is percentage of times users of
the organization have been able to successfully complete the scenario. Scenario
tracking is accomplished by tracking the success factor of granular measures
identified for customer service. The scenarios include out of the box scenarios
as well as customer specific scenarios that have customizations.
