#  Graphical insights into emergent project risks


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

In any project context, knowing how the project is performing and getting out
ahead of problems is job-one for the project manager. A wealth of cost and
schedule variance data is available in the Project Service application itself,
but connections and correlations between metrics can easily be overlooked when
navigating between tabs and views. The Fall '18 release introduces new entity
structures and updated PowerBI reports that improve project manager ability to
identify and drill-into problems quickly.
