#  Use transaction filters to review invoicing backlog when creating invoicesÂ 


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Project Service, creates invoices from all unbilled sales actuals that were
recorded on a project. This feature will introduce a view where you can filter
actuals using the native XRM filter capabilities and mark the transactions that
are ready for invoicing. This will provide better control for the project
managers on what gets invoiced to the customer for each period.
