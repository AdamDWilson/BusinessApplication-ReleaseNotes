Additional Languages
--------------------



Microsoft Social Engagement is further expanding with listening capabilities
into new markets by adding the following languages for data acquisition: Bahasa,
Hindi, Korean, Czech, and Hungarian. Social Engagement UI will be localized as
well in those languages. Furthermore, we are going to localize Social Engagement
UI in all already available data acquisition languages, including Right-to-Left
languages such as Arabic and Hebrew.
