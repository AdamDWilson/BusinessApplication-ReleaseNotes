Richer segmentation experience
------------------------------



Marketers need to build complex segments in their daily work in an efficient and
intuitive way. A host of additional, business-centric operators are added in
order to improve the expressivity of segment definition and make it simpler for
business users to create complex, business-centric marketing segments. An
improved user experience for defining segments allows marketers and business
analysts to create segments more easily and efficiently.
