**Taking care of the fundamentals**
-----------------------------------

Microsoft announced that Dynamics 365 for Talent has been certified for ISO
(27001, 20017 and 27018)  and SOC 2. ISO and SOC compliance guarantees that
personal data is protected and services are secure and available 24/7/365.
“Compliance requirements in health care are very strict and apply for our
deployed software and services. The fact that Dynamics 365 for Talent is ISO and
SOC certified confirmed our decision to roll out Dynamics 365 for Talent
globally.” said Samantha Johnson, CTO at Fabrikam Healthcare.
