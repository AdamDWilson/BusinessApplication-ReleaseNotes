Microsoft Stream brings industry leading Video AI to Dynamics 365. As part of
our promise to make people more productive and connected with video in business
applications, we are bringing several new capabilities to Dynamics 365,

-   **Sales call recordings** in Dynamics CRM – Stream now powers rich insights
    for sales calls that emanating from Dynamics 365, offering actionable
    feedback around the call like key topics discussed, keyword highlighting,
    talk/listen ratio, call sentiment etc. These insights enable sellers to
    follow up on customer discussions, review the topics discussed and hone into
    topics where the customer was excited which will enable the seller to close
    leads faster with actionable insights.

-   **Rich media courses in Dynamics Talent** – Dynamics 365 for Talent Learning
    enables organizations to train and grow their employees. Microsoft Stream is
    the media platform that powers the rich media experiences in Talent by
    enabling rich discovery and playback on any device, anywhere. In addition,
    leveraging AI capabilities like text-to-speech, Stream powers enhanced
    search to find more relevant content based on the learner’s needs.

-   **Support for marketing videos on websites and Emails** – Stream integrated
    into Dynamics Marketing enables not only adding rich media content to
    websites and emails but also enables tracking engagement with rich analytics
    in the Stream video player to enable better lead scoring, tracking and build
    more intelligent marketing campaigns.

All these capabilities are now available with Dynamics 365 Fall updates. “Stream
for Dynamics” can be purchased as an add on to the Dynamics 365 suite or on a
per app basis.
