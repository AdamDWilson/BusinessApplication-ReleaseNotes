#  Mobile Applications for Android and iOS


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Building upon the promise to make video available on any device, anywhere, any
time, we are very pleased to announce all new mobile applications for Android
and iOS platforms. Stream mobile apps extend the web experience by delivering a
native platform experience and brings unique capabilities to the users that
deliver on Microsoft’s mobile first promise. Below are key capabilities in the
newly launched mobile apps,

-   **Intuitive Navigation for search and discovery** of videos while on the go
    – Employees can now benefit from a native app where they can easily search
    for content when they need it without the inconvenience of using a browser
    and complicated sign-in process.

-   **Download videos for offline playback** without compromising security –
    there are times when you may not be connected like taking a flight. Now, you
    can easily download videos to your cell phone securely so that they are
    available for viewing when you need them whether you are connected or not.
    Whether it be training videos for compliance or learning content for
    self-improvement & discovery, video content is available on the go.

-   **Intune and MAM support** – we know companies deeply care about security of
    the data. Stream mobile app comes with Intune integration allowing companies
    to set policies around access and in case the device is lost, you can now
    remotely wipe off all content including any downloaded videos.
