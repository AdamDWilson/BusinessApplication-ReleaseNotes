#  Office 365 Video migration


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Finally, Microsoft is also pleased to share that most of our nearly 2.5 million
active customers have been successfully transitioned from Office 365 Video to
Microsoft Stream. In the next phase of this transition, Office 365 Video will be
shut down on December 31st, 2018. Any remaining customers will have until
December 31st, 2018 to download their content or transition to Stream, and at
that point in time any of their residual O365 Video data will be deleted from
Microsoft servers.

All existing customers of Stream will automatically get the updates announced
today the next time they log-into Stream.

To learn more about todayâ€™s updates, please visit https://stream.microsoft.com
and sign-up for Microsoft Stream to try them out yourself.
