#  Live Events, public videos and a lot more


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

With today’s announcement, customers can do even more with Stream while
continuing to enjoy the modern, easy-to-use portal experience. Enterprise
customers can now leverage Stream for:

-   **Live Events**– Stream now offers live streaming capabilities from the
    Stream portal and from within productivity and teamwork applications like
    Microsoft Teams and Yammer. With this capability, enterprise users can host
    live events like CEO town-halls and divisional broadcasts and make them
    available to employees across the world. Employees located anywhere can
    watch these broadcasts on any device and participate with questions. In
    addition, users get Live DVR to catch up on meetings they join late and
    catch up to the live point with multi-speed playback. Once live broadcasts
    are over, the recordings are available immediately, allowing employees who
    missed the live broadcasts to view them at their convenience. Deep
    integrations with Microsoft Teams and Yammer extends this experience
    seamlessly into these applications as well.

-   **Public external videos –** The \#1 customer request on our ideas forum was
    the ability to easily host and share videos with public audiences, outside
    of the corporate firewall. Common scenarios include sharing videos to
    support product launches, marketing, investor relations calls and how-to and
    introductory videos. We’re pleased to announce that Stream now supports
    public facing videos that can be shared with external audiences. Enterprise
    users can now through a single application manage both internal & external
    facing content & easily embed Stream videos on their public facing web sites
    and blogs, making it easy to share video content without relying on complex
    hosting solutions or requiring end users to sign in to view the content.

-   **Enterprise CDN support –** Video content being bandwidth hungry, requires
    an efficient distribution solution inside corporations to avoid saturating
    the networks. To support more efficient video distribution inside the
    corporate firewall, Microsoft is announcing support for eCDN solutions from
    partners like Hive, Kollective and Ramp. These eCDN solutions enable any
    organization to optimize their video distribution through either p2p
    streaming or cache proxies and offer a great playback experience for all
    employees irrespective of their location or network limitations.

-   **Improved integration** with **Office 365 navbar** and **seamless SSO** for
    SharePoint, Teams and Yammer mobile apps enabling users to consume Stream
    videos from within these apps.

-   **More options to create content –** Stream now has a built-in video and
    screen recorder capability. Users can use the Stream portal and trigger a
    recording from the portal while they talk or present on a topic. With this
    new capability, users can select the full screen or regions of the screen
    for recording to focus the conversation around a demo they are showing or a
    product they want to highlight. This easy to use tool unlocks a whole new
    set of content creation possibilities for Stream.

-   **Enhanced compliance and GOV cloud support –** Stream also announced Tier-D
    compliance, support for government cloud and full GDPR compliance. Stream is
    now fully integrated with Office 365 Audit logs allowing companies to audit
    actions taken in Stream. With this release, Stream is now fully BCDR Level 2
    compliant ensuring higher access to your data in case of disasters ensuring
    continuity of your business.
