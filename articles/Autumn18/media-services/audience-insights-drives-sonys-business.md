[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft and Sony have today announced the results of their collaboration to
deploy the newly launched Audience Insights capabilities as part of the Market
Intelligence product.  The focus of the collaboration was to centralize all of
Sony Crackle’s audience and enterprise data into a single data estate and
extract audience insights, augmented with Microsoft’s proprietary data assets,
that can be used to personalize Crackle’s marketing campaigns, content
experiences and achieve better ad targeting*. *

*“By directly integrating our publishing and ad decisioning systems into the
audience insights generated from the Audience and Marketing Insights products,
we’ve been able to personalize our user experience and ad delivery down to the
individual user level.”* said Gulliver Smithers, SVP of Product and Technology
at Sony Crackle *“this has led to a 20% lift in retention of first time viewers,
30% improvement in number of minutes watched per month, and a 15% gain in our ad
CPM”. *
