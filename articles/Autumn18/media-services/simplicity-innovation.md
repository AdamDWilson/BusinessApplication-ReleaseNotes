#  Simplicity through Innovation


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft is responding to the evolving demands of developers by providing
simplified APIs at the Media Services PaaS layer. By exposing the same media
service building blocks in our new simplified APIs for Azure developers, media
ISVs can leverage Media Services to build applications quickly with the same
trusted compliance & scale of Media Services. In addition, the platform is
investing in improvements to overall performance, scale, and costs to benefit
our Stream customers and reduce costs for our PaaS customers.

-   **New Media Services v3 API hits GA with more language choice for
    developers** – Developers can now utilize a single management and operations
    API that is built directly on the Azure Resource management API, a familiar
    model for all Azure developers. This new API allows customers to get started
    faster with the programming language of their choice, simplified REST API
    calls, and the ability to quickly and easily ingest content directly from
    HTTP, AWS S3 or Azure Blobs. The new ingest capabilities removes a friction
    point and simplifies the ability to pull content into AMS encoding,
    streaming, and content protection features from any repository on the web.
    The addition of new encoding transforms let customers build simple template
    recipes to quickly submit encoding and AI analytics jobs. In addition, the
    Video Indexer features are now fully integrated & available in the core
    platform for Media Services.



-   **Secure, reliable and modern ingest for broadcasters around the world** –
    The new SRT ingest protocol provides a reliable and secure method of
    streaming into the cloud from a wide range of supported on-premises encoders
    and devices. This overcomes the latency & error prone protocols for
    ingesting live content in the first mile to the cloud which is critical in
    ensuring end to end quality of experience.

-   **Simplified Dynamic Packager with Auto-Scaling -** New egress-only Dynamic
    Packaging rates – No more need for managing Streaming Units. The power of
    Azure Media Services streaming capabilities can now be consumed on a truly
    pay-as-you-go basis without the need to reserve origins. Customers will be
    charged only for the GBs packaged through our powerful autoscaling Dynamic
    Packaging feature.

-   **Higher scale and performance for encoding and streaming –** Through new
    investments in the platform architecture and updates to Azure hardware
    platforms, developers and customers of Media Services will see major
    advances in their services including 50% reduced queuing time, automatic
    scaling of live events, 50% reduced time to allocate a new live encoding
    channel, and rapid, faster than real-time turn-around on video AI and audio
    analytics jobs.
