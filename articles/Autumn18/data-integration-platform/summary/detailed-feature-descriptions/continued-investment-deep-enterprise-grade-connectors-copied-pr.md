#  Continued investment in deep, enterprise grade connectors (copied in PR)


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

>   Prioritizing a set of deep connectors to enterprise-critical sources has
>   been a key area of focus for the past year. In June, Microsoft released
>   significant enhancements to their SAP Business Warehouse connectors
>   (Application Server and Message Server) which put Microsoft Power BI at
>   parity or, in some cases, ahead of any other 3rd party BI vendor in terms of
>   connectivity to SAP Business Warehouse. These two connectors have also been
>   certified by SAP.

>   In addition to SAP BW, the SAP HANA connector has also been improved to
>   enable large enterprise capabilities, such as Security Assertion Markup
>   Language (SAML) based Single Sign-On and SSL certificate validation. Like
>   the BW connector, the latest HANA connector is certified by SAP.

>   Other connectors such as Spark have been enhanced to include Single Sign-On
>   support via Kerberos as well. Additionally, Microsoft has evolved several
>   other connectors that were previously released as Beta connectors to become
>   Generally Available, including HDInsight Spark, Google BigQuery, Spark
>   (non-HDInsight), and more.

>   Along with BI-specific SAP connectors, the platform has added new
>   multidimensional connectors that work across CDS for Apps, CDS for
>   Analytics, Power BI, PowerApps, Flow and Logic Apps â€“ including AtScale and
>   Essbase.
