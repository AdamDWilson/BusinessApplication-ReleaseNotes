#  Enterprise grade hybrid connectivity 


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

>   On-premises data gateway now supports the much-requested ability to run a
>   cluster of gateways that are grouped together to form a pool for high
>   availability, load balancing, and failover scenarios.

>   The latest gateway release includes features that have been top customer
>   asks, such as REST APIs to manage on-premises data gateway, Kerberos, and
>   SAML-based single sign-on, improvement to data sources management and the
>   ability to load balance the traffic across multiple gateways in a given
>   cluster and custom connectors.

>   Tenant admins are now able to manage the gateways installed in their tenant
>   through a dedicated administration page in the new Dynamics 365
>   administrator portal.

>   The addition of the above-mentioned features demonstrates how Microsoft has
>   continually evolved its hybrid on-premises data and API connectivity story,
>   by expanding the scope of what was a Power BI specific feature to support
>   hybrid scenarios for PowerApps, Flow, Logic Apps, Azure Analysis Services
>   and Common Data Service. Decoupling the gateway from the Power BI service is
>   allowing the gateway to evolve more quickly to meet market needs. As a
>   result, the gateway infrastructure is now available in all datacenters as
>   each product requires and is no longer limited to the datacenters where
>   Power BI is deployed. Better engineering agility and a faster cadence on
>   gateway service updates are expected going forward due to these changes.
