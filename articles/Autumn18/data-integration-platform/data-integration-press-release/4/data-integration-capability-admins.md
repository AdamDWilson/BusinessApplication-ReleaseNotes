#  Data Integration capability for admins




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

>   Top asks from our customers in the Fall â€™18 release include:

-   **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Accessibility.** General
    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements is one of the top company
    priorities this fall. The data integrator for admins meets GDPR requirements
    that enables access and delete and other GDPR-granted data subject rights.
    Additionally, the data integrator for admins is also compliant with Grade-C
    accessibility requirements.

-   **Improving ability to customize and version templates**. We understand
    every business is different. Since the release of the data integrator for
    admins, majority of our customers have leveraged the ability to customizing
    templates for process-based integration making it a highly used feature. In
    the past, customers had to always start from an existing template and tweak
    it create a new template. We have further enhanced this experience by
    providing a way to create new templates from scratch and provide an ability
    to version templates and validate source and destination solution(s).

-   **A richer data integrator admin dashboard powered by AI.** Earlier this
    year, Microsoft released an admin dashboard that provides a one stop
    real-time view of all project executions and their status with a drill-down
    to view details of executions. The enhanced dashboard now provides richer
    statistics, such as categorization of errors, remediation for frequent
    errors, intelligently suggesting data refresh intervals, data trend analysis
    and sync patterns. All this out-of-the-box, without writing code.

-   **Improved data integration set-up and administration experience with
    performance improvements.** By centralizing all experiences in the new
    Business Platform Admin Center, the data integrator for admins provides an
    improved set-up experience wherein customers no longer need to switch
    between multiple portals. This includes a new ability to create data
    integration support tickets, in-place from the same portal. The project
    execution history will provide the full history over past executions. The
    data import performance will be improved with new automatic mechanisms for
    batching and data parallelism underneath.
