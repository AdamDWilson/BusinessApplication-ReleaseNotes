#  Common Data Model and Data Integration Community Website


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

A Common Data Model & Data Integration website complements the CDM GitHub
repository and the newly launched Power Query community website to provide
guidance, deep-drive articles, and best practices:

-   A **fully interactive, graphical Common Data Model entity explorer**, and
    detailed entity and attribute metadata descriptions, enable developers to
    better understand and leverage existing Common Data Model entities for
    business applications and analytical solution development.

-   **Clear guidance on how to engage with Microsoft formally on becoming a
    strategic partner for potential CDM enhancements for verticals**, to bring
    more applications to the CDS platforms and further enhance the ecosystem of
    ISVs and app developers. This includes a dedicated CDM partner site, such as
    industry accelerator solutions and CDM entities for the HealthCare industry,
    and others.

    -   Descriptions of how these solutions and specific use cases enable joint
        customers and partners to be more successful in using and building
        solutions (on top of CDM and CDS platforms) much more easily, and how
        this creates a thriving ecosystem of additional apps and integrations.

    -   How to learn more about packaged turn-key solutions in AppSource that
        leverage these CDM enhancements, and how to acquire them.

    -   Joint announcements of these strategic partners, and testimonials of our
        joint customers.

-   Consultants interested in **building data integration templates and
    solutions** to connect systems-of-record and SaaS services to CDS, are
    supported with standard connectors, the Data Connector SDK, and guidance and
    best practices on how to transform data to Common Data Model entities.

-   Discussion forums, and UserVoice facilitate and support a community for
    application, data model, and data integration template developers.
