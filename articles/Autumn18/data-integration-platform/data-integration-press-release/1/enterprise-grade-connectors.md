>   connectors across Power BI, CDS for Apps, CDS for Analytics, PowerApps, Flow
>   and Logic Apps.

>   Business Warehouse connectors (Application Server and Message Server) which
>   put Microsoft Power BI at parity or, in some cases, ahead of any other 3rd
>   party BI vendors in terms of connectivity to SAP Business Warehouse (BW).
>   SAP has **certified Microsoftâ€™s connectors for SAP HANA and SAP BW.** In
>   addition, the SAP HANA connector has been improved to enable large
>   enterprise capabilities, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
>   based Single Sign-On and SSL certificate validation. Other improvements
>   include Single Sign-On support via Kerberos for Spark on-premises and
>   releasing existing connectors as Generally Available, including **HDInsight
>   Spark, Google BigQuery, Spark (non-HDInsight)**, and more.

>   There have also been improvements to the connectors within PowerApps, Flow
>   and Logic Apps such as releasing write capabilities for Azure SQL Data
>   Warehouse, numerous Visual Studio Team Services updates including better
>   triggers and support for custom fields, and additional capabilities in the
>   Oracle connector and many more.

>   The platform continues to evolve and has added new connectors that work
>   consistently across CDS for Apps, CDS for Analytics, Power BI, PowerApps,
>   Flow and Logic Apps, part of an effort to better align customer experiences
>   across the full suite of products.
