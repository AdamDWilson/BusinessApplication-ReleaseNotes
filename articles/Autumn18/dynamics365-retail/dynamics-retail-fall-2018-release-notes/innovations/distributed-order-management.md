#### Distributed order management:



Retailers can now take advantage of intelligent Distributed Order Management
(DOM) algorithms to optimize their order fulfilment operations across their
enterprise. DOM automatically determines the best possible fulfillment location
across warehouses, distribution centers, or even stores based on user definable
profiles containing the rules, scope, and delivery methods.

Enhanced order fulfillment capabilities within Retail Modern POS and Cloud POS,
help turn each retail store location into micro-warehouses, which ensures orders
are filled in the most efficient, cost effective manner.
