#### Improved Extensibility: 

Additional user interface and API extensions have been adding to the Retail
headquarters, POS (Retail Modern POS and Cloud POS, and Commerce run-time (CRT),
allowing environments with customization to easily be serviced and updated
without impacting the core application.

Developers can now extend the user interface with custom controls, add or hide
sections or app bar buttons. Requests and triggers can be overridden to allow
custom logic before or after core operations.

In addition, packaging of the core application and add-ins has been improved to
allow support for multiple packages.
