#### Enhanced In-store shift management:

In-store shift and cash management has been improved both from a reliability
standpoint as well as functional capabilities. Additional validation and
handling has been added to account for scenarios where devices move to and from
offline mode, while using shared shifts. Also, users can now view the status of
all active and suspended shifts within the store.
