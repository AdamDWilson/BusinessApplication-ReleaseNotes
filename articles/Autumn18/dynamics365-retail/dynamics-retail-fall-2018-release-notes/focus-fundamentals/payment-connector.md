#  Payment connector:


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

A new omni-channel “out of the box” payment connector to Adyen Payment Services
is available providing credit/debit (EMV) “card-present” payment processing for
Retail Modern POS and Cloud POS (through hardware station), and “card not
present” payment processing for e-commerce/Call Center. The shared omni-channel
token enables seamless flows such as buy online and pickup or return in store.
Note: Card not present and shared token may not make it into the Fall 2018
release.

The Adyen Payment Services are available globally, including the following
markets:

>   (North America) United States, Canada, (Europe) Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
>   France, Germany, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain,
>   Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, (Latin America) Brazil, Mexico,
>   (Asia Pacific) Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New
>   Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand

In addition, the solution has been enhanced and ships with a native connector to
First Data that provides retailers with the ability to simply use out of the box
solution to process payments. Moreover, the extensibility scenarios for payments
have been significantly enhanced so that partners/ISVs can write reliable and
secure 3rd party payment connectors.
