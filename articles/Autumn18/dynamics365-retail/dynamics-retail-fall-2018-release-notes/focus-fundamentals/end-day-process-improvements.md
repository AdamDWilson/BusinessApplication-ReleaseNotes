#### End of day process improvements: 

Statement calculation and posting has been improved, increasing the overall user
experience, performance and reliability of the automated batch processes. User
experience is improved by additional validation and monitors which provide
administrative users full visibility to quickly identify and resolve issues. In
addition, new roll-back and recovery capabilities prevent data corruption and
reduce the need for manual intervention and data fixes. When user actions are
required, the system now provides all pertinent information and suggested steps
to correct the issues.
