#### Retail Cloud Scale Unit:

Retail deployment topologies now include the Retail Cloud Scale Unit (RCSU)
which separates the Retail Server, Cloud POS server, Commerce run-time (CRT),
and channel database components from the core back-office. This improves
performance across all aspects of the system, by distributing the channel
specific workloads into separate scale units and reduces network latency by
optimizing data center deployments based on the channels geographical location.
In addition, the channel components can now be serviced independently, reducing
downtime and allowing for coordination based on back-office or channel
requirements.
