#  Enhanced Customer search:


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Customer search in Retail Modern POS (MPOS) and Cloud POS has been improved by
adding configurable search "shortcuts‚Äù which allows store users to quickly and
easily choose specific criteria (such as phone number or e-mail address) to
narrow their search scope, providing targeted results and improved performance.
In addition, advanced search filters will allow users to refine their searches
across fields.
