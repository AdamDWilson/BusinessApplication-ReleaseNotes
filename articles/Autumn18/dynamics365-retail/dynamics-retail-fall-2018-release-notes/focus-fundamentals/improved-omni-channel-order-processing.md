#### Improved Omni-channel order processing:

Retail Modern POS (MPOS) and Cloud POS users can provide better, more
streamlined customer service by returning products from across multiple
transactions when returning by receipt or from purchase history. Previously,
this required a different return transaction for each originating sale, which
increases the number of steps and checkout time.

In addition, users will be able to perform exchanges during customer order
processing at the store. Previously, this required two transitions when
performing a return and a sale within the same order.
