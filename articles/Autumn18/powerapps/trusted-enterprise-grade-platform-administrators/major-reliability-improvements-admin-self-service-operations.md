#  Major reliability improvements for admin self-service operations


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Admins are appreciating the major gains in the performance and reliability of
management operations within the admin center. With the move to 9.x, admins have
a renewed confidence that when they upgrade, backup, restore, copy, or reset
their environment that it will succeed over 99% of the time.

1.  **Migrating from on-premise to online is faster than ever before** – The
    time it takes to migrate an on-premise deployment of CRM to online has been
    reduced significantly. With the reliability improvements that have been
    rolled out to the on-prem to online (OP2OL) migration services, partners and
    customers are able to quickly iterate.

2.  **Environment provisioning is more reliable** – Admins no longer call
    customer support whenever they need to restore their production environment.
    With major improvements in the reliability of environment operations, admins
    not only have more visibility into the current state of each operation
    (including create, restore, backup, reset, copy, & upgrade), but they also
    have confidence that those operations will complete successfully. **This
    improved reliability results in a reduction of over 15 support tickets per
    day.**
