#  Emerging ecosystem of ISVs on the platform




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

PowerApps and the Common Data Service for Apps have a growing ecosystem of
applications from Microsoft and other software vendors build atop the platform
and store data natively in the Common Data Service like Adobe, SimpleHQ,
BankSight, Dun & Bradstreet and CUNA Mutual AdvantEdge Analytics. This growing
set of applications benefit from increased capabilities that make it possible to
build world-class SaaS applications on the platform.

**Additional Dynamics 365 data available in the Common Data Service for Apps**

1.  **Key Dynamics 365 F&O entities** like Accounts, Customers, and Products are
    available inside of the Common Data Service for Apps out-of-the-box. The
    data and transformational business processes of Dynamics 365 can natively
    span customer engagement and product management.

2.  **All Dynamics 365 for Talent data** is natively stored in the Common Data
    Service for Apps. Core employee data can be easily integrated and extended
    with customer and product data through the Common Data Service, enabling
    unique business processes and insights.

Additionally, all the ISVs and customization knowledge from PowerApps and the
Common Data Service can be leveraged to customize and transform product and
talent management.

**Software Vendors are using the “full platform” to develop high quality
solutions**

1.  ISVs can “pre-certify” their model-driven apps with the Solution Analyzer,
    driving higher quality of packaged solutions for joint customers.

2.  ISVs can build solutions that include both canvas and model driven
    components, create packages and deploy to AppSource and customer tenants,
    enabling new experiences.

3.  An updated ISV business model enables sustainable partnerships with business
    app ISVs.

**New and powerful application management capabilities to enable SaaS-like
experiences**

1.  **Force-upgrade applications –** software vendors can deliver urgent fixes
    and new features more frequently to their customers by publishing updates
    that will be automatically installed for existing customers.

2.  **Flight new features** – software vendors are able to collect valuable
    feedback & perform critical validations on new versions of their
    applications before rolling out to the changes to all their customers.
    During publishing, publishers can define a “flight,” which define a set of
    tenants or environments that have access to a preview version of the
    application.

**New development options**

1.  **Rich APIs for control development** – Developers and ISVs can build
    custom, reusable, solution aware, and responsive controls for model driven
    apps using a rich set of APIs and sample controls. These controls can be
    packaged as solutions and transferred between organizations.

2.  **Embed PowerApps anywhere –** PowerApps embedding SDK allows developers or
    ISVs to embed canvas applications anywhere. The embedding SDK allows the
    host to create PowerApps and host-PowerApps communication. Model driven
    applications can also be embedded anywhere.
