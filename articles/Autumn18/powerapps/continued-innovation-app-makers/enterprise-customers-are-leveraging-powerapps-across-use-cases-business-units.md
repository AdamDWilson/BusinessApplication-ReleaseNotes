#  Enterprise customers are leveraging PowerApps across use cases and business units


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

More enterprise customers are taking a bet on the platform, and more customers
are expanding beyond one or two initial POCs by enabling their business units to
roll out multiple mission-critical apps.

**Built to enterprise standards that allow all organizations to participate**

1.  Accessibility certification for all experiences inline at PowerApps.com

2.  Available in Government Cloud (GCC)

3.  Makers can “bring their own keys” for data encryption

**Better stability, upgrade, and support experiences**

1.  SLAs are incrementally improving across the board and less breaking changes
    occur

2.  When service interruptions happen, over 90% are auto-detected and posted to
    the Service Health Dashboard before the customer opens a support ticket

3.  Support can view model-driven app health and customization risks, more
    efficiently suggesting improvements and resolving issues faster

4.  Makers can opt-in to “new features” for apps until the mandated upgrade date
