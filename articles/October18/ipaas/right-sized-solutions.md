#  Right-sized solutions


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Azure Integration Services are popular with a growing number of customers.
Customers have been seeking the ability to run their integration workloads
across a wider range of platform and payment options. Larger organizations look
for enhanced isolation and predictable pricing while smaller teams sometimes
look for an execution-based pricing model or for an entry-level tier for a
service. To support these needs, the team has been executing on:

-   **More choices for Logic Apps scaling** – announced at //build 2018, Logic
    Apps are now available in an isolated SKU. This allows customers to consume
    Logic Apps in a predictable manner and have control over more of the
    execution environment for their integration workflows. Furthermore, Logic
    Apps are now available in China for Azure customers.

-   **More choices for APIM scaling –** APIM customers who are looking for the
    ability to guarantee that capacity is available in times of heavy traffic
    are now able to configure auto-scale rules. Furthermore, customers who wish
    to leverage an entry-level version of APIM are now able to use an API
    Gateway (an “5x5 APIM product”) that is free to get started with and is
    billed on a pay-per-execution basis leveraging Serverless infrastructure.
    With this approachable API Gateway, customers will be able to quickly
    publish and expose their APIs to their enterprise.
