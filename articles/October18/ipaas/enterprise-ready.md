#  Enterprise ready


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Integration is a mission critical aspect of any large enterprise infrastructure.
With the ongoing process of digital transformation, reliable integration
solutions are needed to bridge the gap between existing on-premises business
systems and new services implemented using Cloud platforms and SaaS. Some of the
investments in the larger enterprise requirements include:

-   **Modern API support** – the APIM product set now supports OpenAPI v3.0 as
    well as HTTP 2.0.

-   **Extended integration capabilities** – Logic Apps now support XSLT V3.0
    templates as well as an enhanced, GA release of the SAP connector.

-   **Integration developer productivity enhancements** – Logic Apps provide a
    unique authoring capability through the Workflow designer (used by Microsoft
    Flow as well). Integration developers can now enjoy a set of intuitive
    capabilities based on data collected from other users thus enabling a faster
    experience of finding applicable connectors and reusing existing workflows.
