#  Overview


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI has a wide set of capabilities for ISVs and developers focused on three
scenarios

-   **Power BI Apps** enabling no code/low code experiences for Power BI
    partners to build Power BI apps and publish them in AppSource for all Power
    BI customers. The platform helps our partners build, market, sell, and grow
    their business faster,

-   **Power BI Embedded**, to enable SaaS application developers to seamlessly
    add Power BI analytics within the applications they develop, and

-   **Power BI Visuals** to enable the development of unique visuals that can be
    used like any other native Power BI visual
