#  Integration with Azure Service Health 




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

When issues in Azure services affect your business-critical resources, Azure
Service Health notifies you and your teams. It helps you understand the impact
of the issue, and keeps you updated as the issue is resolved. It also helps you
prepare for planned maintenance and changes that could affect the availability
of your resources. Use this service to track the availability of Power BI
Embedded resources.
