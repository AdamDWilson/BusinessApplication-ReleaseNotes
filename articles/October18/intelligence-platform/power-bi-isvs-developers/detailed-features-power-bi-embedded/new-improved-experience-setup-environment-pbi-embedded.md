#  New and improved experience to setup your environment for PBI Embedded




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Setting up a new environment to develop and deploy Power BI Embedded involves
defining and configuring multiple entities. With the new onboarding tool, we are
making this process simpler and faster.

The setup for Power BI Embedding is done through 4 steps (see above). With each
step, the required information is available in the Summary tile on the right.
The last step enables importing a report and results in an application being
created for the developer. The experience ends with a working application that
can be used as a sample or reference.
