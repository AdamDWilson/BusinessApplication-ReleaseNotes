#  Bookmark support




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI Apps can apply bookmarks to embedded reports to control their UI
elements through APIs. With the Bookmarks API, developers

-   can control an application userâ€™s experience, by applying specific bookmarks
    on load, or after a specific action in the app's flow,

-   show/ hide the bookmarks pane and

-   apply or disable storytelling through bookmarks.

We also are adding an option to create a personalized experience by capturing a
report's state and creating a bookmark to be managed and saved by the
application. This enables developers to control who can use this bookmark and
when to apply it to the report.
