#  Workspace collection deprecation




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

In June 2017, we announced the ability to embed Power BI using new APIs and the
convergence of the APIs with the Power BI service. This was announced as part of
the release of Power BI Premium followed by Power BI Embedded offerings in
Azure. At the same time, we announced the deprecation of the workspace
collection effective June 2018.

There is a migration path from workspace collections to the new Power BI
Embedded solution. Starting in June 2018, there will not be a way to create a
new workspace collection and applications that use this solution need to migrate
to the new Power BI Embedded offering.
