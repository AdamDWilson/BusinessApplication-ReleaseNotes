#  Embedding Power BI content from Power BI Apps




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI is the primary service for consuming Power BI content originating from
Power BI Apps. The consumption of Power BI content can also be embedded in other
services and applications such as SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, and
Dynamics 365. We are adding the ability to embed Power BI content (reports and
visuals) from Power BI Apps to enable the consumption of the insights these Apps
offer in other services and applications.
