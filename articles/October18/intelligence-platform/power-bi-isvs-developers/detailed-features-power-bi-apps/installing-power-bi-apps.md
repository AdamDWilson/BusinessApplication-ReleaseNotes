#  Installing Power BI Apps




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI Apps are developed using various Power BI artifacts from the data
connectors used to populate the Common Data Service for Analytics, to the
reports that visualize the data for the users. To start to use an app, a user
needs to run an installer that installs the App into the userâ€™s Power BI tenant
and configures the various artifacts in the app deployment package including
defining relevant data source connection credentials and configurations.
