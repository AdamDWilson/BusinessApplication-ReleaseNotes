#  Personalization




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

After installing a Power BI App, users will have the ability to personalize the
application to suit their needs. For example, a user focusing on sales in Europe
can personalize the application to process and visualize data for Europe, while
another user focusing on North America can personalize it to this specific
region.
