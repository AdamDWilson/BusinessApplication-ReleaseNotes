#  Intelligence Platform



[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

With a focus on delivering immediate "out of the box" value to business users, 
Power BI has enabled users to address their own needs through a combination of 
prepackaged content and the ease of developing and sharing reports and dashboards 
with colleagues. The resulting pervasive access to insights has proven a key 
enabler to organizations adopting a data-driven culture.

The Autumn 2018 release includes several innovations that further the 
democratization of intelligence across the enterprise:

**Power BI Desktop**

Microsoft has rapidly delivered over 215 Power BI Desktop features in a series of
monthly updates, in response to passionate user feedback on proposed features. 
This fall release includes ways for report consumers to tweak visuals to answer a 
specific question about their data, even if they don’t have edit access to the report, 
support for a pivot-table like expand / collapse on the matrix visual and continued 
improvements to Q&A usability.

For Power BI authors, the Desktop adds composite models which allow data mash
ups across Direct Query and imported data sources, to augment data with
additional insights. New navigation options include bookmark grouping, filters
in the data view and expression-based formatting to enable authors to create
rich Power BI content with ease.

Power BI Desktop continues to use AI and natural language to make authors’ lives
easier. Authors can now tag visuals as answers to questions their users might
ask using Q&A. By leveraging new telemetry from Power BI, ISVs can learn how Q&A
is being used in their Apps and use this data to improve Q&A results. In
addition, authors now have more control over Quick Insights, specifying which
categories should be surfaced in results for specific measures. These
capabilities allow report authors to ensure users get the best results, by
leveraging both AI and the author's domain knowledge.

**Customers can now standardize on a single platform for the full spectrum of
end user needs**

Power BI has transformed how businesses operate by enabling business users to
explore and collaborate to find insights and move the metrics that matter.
Increasingly organizations are looking to consolidate on a single platform for
their analytics needs. In the Autumn Release, Power BI is making this possible 
through capabilities in Power BI Premium:

-   **Enterprise reporting**, in the form of pixel-perfect operational reports
    built using SQL Server Report Builder, can now be delivered to end users
    alongside Power BI’s existing interactive reports to create a unified,
    secure, enterprise-wide report repository accessible to any user across
    devices. Additionally, Power BI is improving managed distribution, by
    allowing reports to be emailed to multiple users, configured with filtered
    views of data, and distributed as PDF documents.

-   **Enterprise-scale BI models** enable organizations to serve end users with
    reports that are fast, highly-available, easy to manage, and aligned to the
    organization’s compliance requirements. With incremental refresh and
    aggregations, Power BI Premium can query data *of any size*, while still
    enabling quick, interactive end user experiences.

-   **With multi-Geo** compliance, customers can deploy Premium in specific
    regions globally to keep data close to end users for optimal performance and
    to meet data residency requirements.

-   Finally, with **new API support** for datasets through the XMLA protocol,
    customers can achieve enterprise-grade lifecycle management even with large
    BI teams.

**ENABLING THE DIGITAL FEEDBACK LOOP**

As organizations adopt software to digitally transform they need to apply modern
analytical techniques to extract insights from the transactional and
observational data they collect, to drive intelligent actions that can transform
their business processes and customer experiences. Collecting and acting on the
observable events associated with each business process creates digital feedback
loops that generate the intelligence that can guide and automate business
processes.

Organizations trying to gain insight and take intelligent action encounter
several challenges:

-   Inefficiencies due to incomplete, siloed data across multiple applications.

-   Complex integration projects to integrate data across silos which require
    time, money and specialist expertise.

-   Large volumes of observational data collected from customer interactions,
    and product telemetry that need to be integrated and disambiguated to get to
    a single unified view of a customer, product, or person.

The Autumn release includes general availability of the Common Data Service for
Analytics and a preview of Customer 360.

**The Common Data Service for Analytics helps unify and enrich data in the
Common Data Model**

The Common Data Service for Analytics reduces the time, complexity, and cost of
building systems of intelligence from data spanning multiple business
applications and data sources. It does this by simplifying and automating the
ingestion, transformation, integration, and enrichment of standard business
application entities, derived from a Common Data Model, and making those
business entities available to users of Power BI and Power BI enabled solutions.

With the Common Data Service for Analytics, organizations can:

-   Quickly unify their transactional and observational data with a standard
    schema for common business entities across business functions such as
    marketing, sales, service, operations, finance and talent.

-   Enrich that data with high value data from Microsoft, such as data from
    Office 365.

-   Enable their analysts to leverage out-of-the-box, point and click access to
    artificial intelligence capabilities.

-   Enable developers and data scientists to easily connect data in the Common
    Data Service for Analytics to Azure services, such as Azure Machine
    Learning, Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

The Fall release includes

-   The ability for customers to leverage the full power of the Azure data
    platform with their data in CDS for Analytics.

-   Out-of-the-box transformations for sentiment analysis and keyword
    extraction.

-   Automatic creation of predictive scoring, forecasting and classification
    models for business entities.

-   The ability to operate on business entities in the Common Data Service for
    Analytics with in-lake transforms to generate new insights through entity
    enrichment.

-   The ability to embed insights derived from the Common Data Service for
    Analytics into applications like Dynamics 365.

**Customer can get insights in minutes through apps from Microsoft and ISV
partners on AppSource**

Microsoft is delivering a suite of Power BI Insight Apps that deliver value to
business customers in minutes all based on data in the Common Data Model.
Microsoft is also partnering closely with several ISVs who are creating industry
extensions to the Common Data Model, and shipping applications that provide out
of the box insights through Power BI.

The Fall release includes

-   New insights apps from Microsoft for Sales, Service, Marketing, Operations,
    Finance and Talent as well as IT.

-   Industry solutions from companies like CUNA Mutual Group whose AdvantEdge 
    Analytics solution helps Credit Union better serve their members.

These solutions are enabled by the Power BI ISV platform which is adding new
capabilities including

-   A new developer portal with the resources developers need to develop their
    Power BI solutions.

-   Automatic end to end deployment of Power BI Embedded solutions.

-   Integration with Azure diagnostics and Azure health.

-   The ability to programmatically install, manage, embed, monitor usage of &
    enforce licensing for Power BI apps.

**Customer 360 creates a rich 360o view of your customers**

At the core of digitally transforming customer engagement processes is a
deep understanding of customers, which comes from observing activities across
online and offline channels. Microsoft has unique datasets, which can be joined
with data to enrich it.

As part of the Autumn release, Microsoft is releasing a Customer 360° Power BI app 
which enables delivery of tailored insights to specific customer facing roles like 
service agents, campaign managers and sales professionals. The app is based on 
Profile 360°, a new Power BI capability which enables you to leverage artificial 
intelligence & matching algorithms to create unified master records for business 
entities like "Customer", which can then be enriched with Microsoft data from Bing 
and Office 365. For example, Bing Audience Intelligence helps enrich customer profiles
with interests, purchase intent, and demographics. The capabilities of Profile 360
can also be applied to other core entities like Product and People.
Organizations can leverage these unified and enriched profiles to make their
business processes more intelligent.

With these enhancements to Power BI, organizations can turn data into
intelligence that drives intelligent action, without long, complex development
cycles. At the foundation is the collection and storage of transactional and
observational data that is algorithmically transformed into intelligence about
customers, products, and people, that can be used to transform business
processes.
