#  Common Data Service for Analytics Computed Entities (in-lake transformations)


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Common Data Service for Analytics now allows BI professionals to generate
insights from their business data, using a self-service low-code/no-code, SaaS
experience, based on the familiar and popular Power Query experience. In April,
we introduced the capability to ingest custom data and map it to known Common
Data Model entities, customized entities, or entirely new entities. Now, once
business entities are ingested, the Common Data Service for Analytics allows
users to generate new insights by transforming, tailoring, decorating, and
enriching entities, as well as aggregating large data scales. Static analysis of
Power Query M expressions allows the Common Data Service for Analytics to
identify dependencies between entities to ensure they are computed and updated
in the optimal order, without the need for a user to manually author and
orchestrate a data task flow. Support for calculated entities allows third
parties to build Power BI apps atop the Common Data Service for Analytics with
richer insights and AI capabilities. For example, enriching a customer account
entity from Dynamics 365 for Sales with information from open service tickets in
Dynamics 365 for Service, and relevant customer meeting information from Office
365.
