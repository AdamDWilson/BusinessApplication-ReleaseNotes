#  Datapool Entity References 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Common Data Service for Analytics allows Business Analysts or applications
to refer to, and reuse entities already present in CDS for Analytics storage. A
Business Analyst can refer to entities which have been ingested, by other
datapools, or mounted from external storage, without having to duplicate or copy
those entities. These entity references can be used in the transformation,
enrichment, or calculation of new entities. Avoiding duplication using entity
references helps to maintain a single source of the truth.
