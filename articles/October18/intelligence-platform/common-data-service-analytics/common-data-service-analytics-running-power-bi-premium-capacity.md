#  Common Data Service for Analytics running on Power BI Premium capacity


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

A Power BI Administrator can now easily allocate capacity for Common Data
Service for Analytics as part of an existing Power BI Premium subscription. Once
capacity is allocated, the Common Data Service for Analytics will have access to
the Power BI Premium storage (100TB per P1 node), and dedicated capacity to run
entity computation operations, and parallel execution of transforms. The
Administrator can track capacity usage, resolve bottlenecks, and scale up
capacity as needed.
