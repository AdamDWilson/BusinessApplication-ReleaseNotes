#  Common Data Service for Analytics Integration with Azure


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

In April, the Common Data Service for Analytics introduced the capability to
mount an external datapool to your managed Common Data Service for Analytics
storage. Various applications such as Credit and Collections, CUNA AdvantEdge
Analytics, and the Sales Insights App, leveraged this capability. Now, Power BI
administrators will be able to configure the Common Data Service for Analytics
to use an Azure storage subscription. All Common Data Service for Analytics data
& metadata will be copied to the provided storage account, and the Common Data
Service for Analytics will continue to operate seamlessly. By doing so,
developers and data scientists will be able to easily connect Common Data
Service for Analytics data to Azure services such as Azure Machine Learning,
Azure Databricks, and Azure Data Factory providing a wide range of possibilities
to gain new insights from the business data.
