#  Built-In Support for the Common Data Model 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Common Data Service for Analytics is based on the Common Data Model. In the
Fall release, we are adding capabilities to improve support for the Common Data
Model

-   Published updates to the Common Data Model automatically appear within
    entity mapping experiences

-   Custom extensions to the Common Data Model are surfaced within datapool
    authoring experiences

-   The Common Data Service for Analytics indicates whether entities are part of
    the Common Data Model or are custom, and whether they conform to the
    required schema & structure.
