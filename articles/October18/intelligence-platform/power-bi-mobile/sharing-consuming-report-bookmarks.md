#  Sharing and Consuming Report bookmarks 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Sharing insights sometimes requires users to view and share report data filtered
in a given way that reveals insights. Today, users can only share reports with
default state as defined by the report’s author. With bookmarks, users can share
a filtered (and/or sliced) report in a different state, which enables better
collaboration on data that needs the user’s attention. When sharing a report,
users will be able to choose whether to share the report with its current
filters and slicers (sharing a bookmark of the report), or to share it in its
default state. When receiving a bookmark, the app will load the report with the
relevant filtered state and will present the user an indication that the report
is filtered.
