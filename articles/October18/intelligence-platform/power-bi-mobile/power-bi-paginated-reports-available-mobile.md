#  Power BI Paginated reports available in mobile 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Paginated reports will become first-class artifacts in apps and workspaces in
Power BI. Users will be able to author paginated reports and publish them to the
Power BI service. With this functionality, mobile users will also be able to
consume these reports in the app. Being a first-class artifact in Power BI,
users can add paginated reports to their favorites, see them in recent views,
and share them with other users in the same manner as other artifacts.
