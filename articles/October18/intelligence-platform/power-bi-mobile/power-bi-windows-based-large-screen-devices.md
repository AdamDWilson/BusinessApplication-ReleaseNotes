#  Power BI on Windows-based large screen devices 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Large touch screens like the Surface Hub are used for data presentation and team
collaboration. The Power BI mobile app on large screens allows users to use the
large touch screen in an intuitive way, with an experience that optimizes the
way data is presented and explored in large screens.

The enhanced experience for large screens includes:

-   Chromeless view – optimized for data presentation by removing all chrome
    from all app components (title, filters, visuals borders, navigation) to
    allow maximum real-estate for the presented content. Only the action bar is
    presented to allow the user to access tools they might need during a
    presentation for exploration and collaboration (inking, page transition).

-   Proximal filters – while in chromeless mode, users exploring their data
    still need access to report filters. Proximal Filters is a new concept in
    which filter options will just “pop-up” on the report upon touch by the
    user, allowing a fluid exploration experience (instead of having the user
    reach out to the side of the screen to access them.)

-   Single Sign On (see previous section).
