#  B2B integration 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Power BI Mobile users expect to have access to reports and dashboards shared
with them by users from other tenants directly from their mobile device. Today,
this functionality exists only using mobile browsers. With this new capability,
mobile users can also access and view these shared items natively in the mobile
app. Users will be able to view and consume all shared content across other
tenants similarly to content that exists in their own tenant.
