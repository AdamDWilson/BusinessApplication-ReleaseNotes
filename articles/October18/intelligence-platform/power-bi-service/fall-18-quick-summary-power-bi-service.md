[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

| Oct ’ 18 | **General Availability** |
|----------|--------------------------|
|          | **Power BI**             |
| Oct ‘18  | **Public Preview**       |
|          | **Power BI**             |

-   **Data Source Setup Improvements.** Easily configure gateways and diagnose
    common errors.

-   **Dashboard theming.** Change the visual appearance of dashboards to match
    your organization’s brand, including background and tile colors.

-   **Custom Connectors in Personal and Enterprise Gateway.** Support for
    connectors developed with the [Data Connector
    SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/DataConnectors) for scheduled refresh
    using the Power BI gateways.

-   **Admin APIs for content access.** As a Power BI Service Administrator, you
    can call APIs to retrieve all the content in your tenant, regardless of who
    the owner is. This includes datasets, dashboards, and reports.

-   **Accessibility in the Admin Portal.** Pages in the admin portal will be
    updated to better meet accessibility needs, including support for keyboard
    navigation and screen readers.

-   **Request Access for Apps.** Provide streamlined access to apps by allowing
    end users to request access to apps they do not have permission to, like
    dashboards today.

-   **Share Reports with Filters.** When sharing a report, choose whether to
    share with the current filters you have set so that the recipient sees the
    same context that you do.

-   **Admin APIs for gateways.** As a Power BI Service Administrator, you can
    call an API to discover gateways in your organization.

-   **Subscribe Others to Emails.** Subscribe other users or distribution lists
    to scheduled emails of reports and dashboards.

-   **Usage Metrics for Power BI Service Administrators.** Get insight on
    workspace, report, and dataset usage across the tenant, including number of
    users and frequency of use.

-   **Commenting.** Comment on reports and dashboards to provide context and ask
    questions.

-   **Personal bookmarks.** As an end user, create bookmarks for a Power BI
    report so you can quickly get to your most important insights.

-   **Export to PowerPoint with Filters.** When exporting to PowerPoint, the
    currently applied filters on a report will be used, allowing you to create
    personalized exports tailored for different audiences.

-   **Email Subscriptions with Filters.** When setting up email subscriptions,
    the currently applied filters on a report will be used, allowing you to
    create personalized subscriptions tailored for different audiences.

-   **Shared and certified datasets.** Connect to a shared dataset from the
    Power BI service or Desktop. Dataset owners can certify datasets that are
    authoritative sources in their organizations. Administrators can control who
    is authorized to certify datasets.

**Dataset metadata translations.** Users see dataset fields in their client
locale and language when translations are defined in the dataset or Analysis
Services model.

**Export to PDF.** Export a report to PDF.

**Power BI Premium**

-   **Historical capacity metrics.** In addition to current summary data, see a
    graph of individual data points over the past week for capacity metrics like
    CPU utilization, memory thrashing, and Direct Query utilization.
    Additionally, a new metric for memory utilization will be added.

-   **Incremental data refresh.** Incrementally load new data into a dataset
    without reloading all the previous data.

-   **Workspaces with Azure AD groups.** Workspaces have their own roles and
    permissions separate from Office 365 groups to enable more control over
    workspaces, including assigning workspace roles to individual users.

-   **Multi-Geo for Compliance.** Choose where your data is stored to meet your
    organization’s unique regulatory requirements, even when they vary across
    subsidiaries or departments. When provisioning Premium capacity, choose to
    deploy among regions worldwide where Power BI operates, even if that region
    is different than your tenant’s Power BI region.

-   **RDL Reports.** Upload RDL reports built using SQL Server Reporting
    Services Report Builder, and distribute them along with other Power BI
    content through sharing or Power BI Apps.

-   **Home.** Home brings together your most-frequently used content with an
    at-a-glance view of the metrics that matter to you, so you can quickly
    understand the state of your business and find the information you need.

-   **Global search.** Search and find content across your workspaces from one
    search box.

-   **Query acceleration for large datasets.** Dataset authors can create
    in-memory aggregations to enable interactive queries over big data.
