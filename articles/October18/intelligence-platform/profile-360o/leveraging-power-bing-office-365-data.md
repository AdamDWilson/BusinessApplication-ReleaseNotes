#  Leveraging the power of Bing and Office 365 data


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The Common Data Services for Analytics is now natively integrated with the Bing
Audience Intelligence Platform enabling Power BI to enrich specific entities
with additional attributes, preferences, and inferences. We also support native
integration with Office 365 allowing customers to fuse email and calendar
related information into Profile 360Â°.
