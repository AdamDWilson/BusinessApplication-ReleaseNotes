#  Building the Platform


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

First, Microsoft Flow is part of the **single maker experience for the entire
Business Application platform**. There are now common underlying concepts: a
single security model for all resources, a common approach to solution
management, version control and history. The way that makers distribute their
applications and flows is now common, meaning makers can share their flows –
including recurring flows – in their organization based on security roles in the
Common Data Service for Apps. The user interfaces are also now integrated –
flows can be authored and invoked inside the PowerApps Studio.

Second, there is a common underling administration and data layer. Flows
natively connect to CDS without needing a connector, simplifying the
installation and management of workflows. This means that flows now have **100%
parity with the legacy asynchronous Common Data Service for Apps workflows**. On
the Data Loss Protection front, DLP is now fully content-aware at runtime,
meaning that it can prevent data from passing from an HBI SharePoint site to an
LBI site, while still allowing content to move from an LBI site to an HBI site.
Microsoft IT has published a new case study, sharing how they consider this the
gold standard in how new Microsoft products enable governance.

Lastly, to delight users of the platform, Microsoft Flow has added features that
address every single request with more than 50 votes on the ideas forum. Over
the past few months these ideas have fallen into two major areas: designer
usability and dealing with errors. For example, Flow is adding designer
capabilities like copy and paste of actions. Likewise, to aid failure recovery
when there is more than one failure, Flow has introduced the ability to bulk
resubmit previous runs.
