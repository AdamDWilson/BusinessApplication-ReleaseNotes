#  Better together with Office 365


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Starting today, Microsoft Flow now has **full parity with all features in
SharePoint Designer 2013**. This was made possible through updates on several
fronts:  
Added over a dozen missing actions in the SharePoint connector.

-   Enhancements to Microsoft Flow’s modern approvals functionality.

-   Business process flows integration into SharePoint – so users can see the
    status of, and move forward or backward in, a process from the context of a
    document.

Along with these new capabilities, a Microsoft partner, Rencore, is developing a
tool that will automatically migrate SharePoint Workflows to Flow.

In addition to SharePoint, Flow has focused on **Microsoft Teams** integration.
Flow is now **the recommended way for all users to build Teams bots**. There are
several capabilities to support this, like the ability to invoke a Flow directly
from the *PowerBar* and there is no longer needing to “install” the Microsoft
Flow Teams app.

Although Microsoft Flow’s focus has been on SharePoint and Teams, there have
also been ongoing enhancements to other integrations with Office 365 through
more capable connectors, for example, new triggers and actions in the **Office
365 Outlook** and **Planner** connectors.
