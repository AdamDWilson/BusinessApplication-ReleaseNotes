#  Intelligence and insights


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Flow empowers people to build processes so they, their team, and their
organization can be more successful, through both human-driven business process
flows, and computer-driven automated flows.

Now, Microsoft Flow is infusing intelligence into the DNA of these flows to
enable **more intelligent processes**. For example, flows can drive the *next
best action* for a process through an understanding of performance of previous
iterations, and by looking at other instances of the process in the
organization. Thus, a flow can be more effective every iteration that it goes
through.

Flow will enable this by building on the Common Data Service for Analytics and
Microsoft Cognitive Services (no Azure subscription required). With this new
direction, Microsoft Flow is now being evaluated for the 2019 MQ of the
**intelligent Business Process Management** (iBMS) category in Gartner, the same
category that Pegasoft is the Leader in.
