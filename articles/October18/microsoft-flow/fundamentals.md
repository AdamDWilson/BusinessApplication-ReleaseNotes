#  Fundamentals


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Building an exceptionally reliable product is key for enterprises to invest in
Microsoft Flow. Flow is creating an **invincible platform** by committing to
"four nines" of reliability and 95th percentile latency under one second for all
core scenarios. At the same time, Flow is now providing **excellent support** to
customers by giving support engineers deep visibility into everything that is
happening for a given user. With this contextual information, support can solve
virtually any customer issue quickly, and efficiently, without the potentially
time-consuming step of engaging with the engineering team.



Beyond the fundamentals of the service, Microsoft Flow has also been investing
in the fundamentals of the business. Flow closely tracks the patterns of new and
existing users to identify which features lead to linear growth, versus features
that cause viral loops â€“ and thus warrant further investment. Flow also has been
tracking long-term retention of user cohorts to identify high-impact
opportunities for improved stickiness.
