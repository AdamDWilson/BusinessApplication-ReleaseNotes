#  Support for Upgrade and N-1 (AX2012): 


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Existing Dynamics AX2012 retailers can now upgrade their back-office
headquarters components to the latest Dynamics 365 for Retail, while allowing
their distributed store systems to remaining on the AX 2012 R3 version (N-1).
This allows staged roll-outs, upgrading the store systems over-time, during
optimal scheduled downtimes. In addition, Retailers deploying new (non-upgrade)
Dynamics 365 back office systems can now take advantage of the N-1 capabilities.

Moreover, Investments have been made to improve the experience and reliability
of the end to end upgrade process of various customers running Dynamics 365
Retail/Finance and Operations (7.0, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3), including improved
support for backwards and forwards compatibility between minor version updates.
