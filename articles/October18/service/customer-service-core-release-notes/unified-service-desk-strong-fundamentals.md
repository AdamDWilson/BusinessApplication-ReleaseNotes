#  Unified Service Desk: Strong Fundamentals 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

1.  **USD Scenario Based Telemetry**: Unified Service Desk will add the
    necessary infrastructure to enable capture of health and performance
    telemetry in the April release. Continuing from there, we will target
    reliability and performance metrics of our top P0 Scenario, its Sub
    Scenarios to roll up in the overall Bedrock reporting. This involves
    identifying and addressing gaps in the existing telemetry instrumentation
    and sending telemetry data to the bedrock systems for reporting.

2.  **USD 360 Dashboard:**  We will deliver a consolidated Unified Service Desk
    Dashboard which will give a snapshot of Usage, Service Health and Support
    across our USD deployments, We will enable drill down to identify the root
    cause when the metrics miss target thresholds. This investment will also
    help us to proactively monitor the health of our top customers.

1.  **USD Reliability:** The current implementation to host CRM Pages in Unified
    Service Desk will be refactored in order to facilitate quicker diagnosis of
    customer introduced customizations as well as allow recovery from errors
    originating from browser processes. This will help reduce the mean time to
    mitigation of issues and increase NPS for customers accessing CRM pages from
    USD.
