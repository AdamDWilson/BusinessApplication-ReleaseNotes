#  Adjustments to approved Time, Expense and Journal lines 


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

This feature will give the much-needed ability for a Project Administrator to
make changes to approved time and expenses entries. Most project-based companies
setup temporary codes for projects, tasks and other attributes like work
categories and have consultants log time against these interim references until
the permanent codes are setup in the system. It is also common to reclassify
time on task to another task on the same project or on a different project for
the same customer. In a good majority of such cases, changing of this reference
data will also impact financial postings in the ERP or Accounting system.  This
feature will allow these updates to approved actuals and handle the updates with
historical trail.
