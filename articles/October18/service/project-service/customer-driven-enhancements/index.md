#  Customer-driven Enhancements


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

From an end-user perspective, application usability and feature-functional
richness are perennial and sometimes counterbalancing demands. As a relatively
young product offering, Project Service still has considerable runway for
improvement and expansion in both areas. We therefore take customer feedback as
a critical driver for a range of functional investments in each major release. A
sample list of the top customer-requested items that we are working on for the
Fall '18 release follows:

-   Unit-aware expense category pricing for setup, estimation and actuals

-   Adjustments to approved Time, Expense and Journal lines

-   Review and selection from invoicing backlog to bulk create invoices
