#  Unit-aware expense category pricing for setup, estimation and actuals 


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

With this feature, Project Service solution will support a unit – based pricing
method for Expense Categories. This will enable scenarios such as the following:

1.  Mileage reporting on projects by travelling consultants

2.  Pricing by project deliverables based on units of work. A number of industry
    verticals like Accounting firms (where Tax returns are priced by unit), BPO
    firms (where support calls are priced by units of calls processed) will be
    able to leverage this capability to estimate and track projects costs and
    revenue that is closer to their business model

3.  Provide a way to price and cost for subcontracted deliverables as delivery
    units. When work that is subcontracted does not need to be tracked at the
    granularity of time or expenses incurred by the vendor but rather in terms
    of units of output that were completed and delivered by the vendor, the
    ability to model vendor’s delivery units as a category of expense that can
    be priced by unit will be a key capability.
