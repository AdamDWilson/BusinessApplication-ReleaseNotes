#  Customer Owned Bots for Omnichannel




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Today, consumers are increasingly demanding that the companies serve their needs
and answer their requirements quickly, efficiently, and accurately. At the same
time, there is a generational shift towards usage of self-service channels, with
these channels finding resonance with the consumers, particularly the
millennials. According to predictions from Gartner Research, by 2020 consumers
will handle most of their engagements with businesses without ever interacting
with another human being.

Recent evolution in machine learning technologies, natural language research and
linguistic analysis, along with ability to provide scalable, immediate and
contextual assistance has made self-service tools like chatbots (or virtual
agents) a key necessity to be incorporated within the companyâ€™s customer service
operations. Apart from the ubiquity and 24/7 availability offered by these
virtual agents, interactions with them could also be used to come up with
detailed analysis in regards with understanding consumer sentiment, level of
engagement, and product feedback. Integration of intelligent bots within
customer service operations, positively impacts Customer Service KPIs like
Average Handling Time, Average number of Cases, while simultaneously reducing
cost.

With Omnichannel, customers can now bring their own bots and connect them with
the Omni-Channel ecosystem, through a simplified setup experience. Intelligent
conversational bots at frontline help to deflect the routine queries, while
maintaining a natural experience for the end user. Integration with Omnichannel
enables a smooth, contextual handoff to the agents, helping them to focus on
complex queries, while empowering them with relevant information, leading to a
delightful experience for the end user.
