#  Chat Channel for Omnichannel 




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

*This is a P0 ask from Department of Veteran Affairs for the Omni Channel
feature work*

As the products and services are evolving and competing aggressively,
organizations across all business segments are using customer service as a
competitive differentiator to keep their existing customers, while acquiring new
ones. This, along with the strategic shift towards conversational messaging has
forced organizations to add support beyond traditional customer interaction
channels like email and phone. Live Chat, along with asynchronous messaging
channels like In-App asynchronous messaging as well as consumer channels like
Facebook messenger have emerged as one of the drivers of this new trend.

Chat Experience in omnichannel will empower businesses

-   To interact with customers right on their portals and mobile apps when they
    have reached out to businesses

-   To provide rich and intelligent context across all channels with customer
    360, immersive and productive experience enabling Agents to resolve issues
    within business SLAs, hence higher CSAT

-   Chatbot integration and Supervisor scenarios provide good levers of
    differentiation

-   To configure, customize, extend it to suit portal and business needs with
    quick, easy setup and extensibility features for theming, routing, queuing,
    surveys, experience… all under the same hood

Existing offering powered by Partner – Cafex has several limitations like data
compliance challenges due to data residing outside of dynamics 365, lack of
integrated omnichannel experience for Agent, Admin and Supervisor persona as
well as disjointed licensing and support experiences.
