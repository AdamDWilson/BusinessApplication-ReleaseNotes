#  Simplified Customization & Administration




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

This feature focuses on simplifying the current administration and customization
capabilities of Portals into two different areas, each targeted towards the
corresponding personas: Portal Administrators (and) Portal Customizers. Portal
Administrators get a modern, simplified and contextual experience that helps
them manage Portals better. Portal Customizers get a modern WYSIWYG based CMS
that helps them craft beautiful visual experiences without having to understand
/ navigate the complexities of the Portal data model.

Providing a persona-focused tool improves productivity and lays the foundation
to provide differentiated experiences in the upcoming releases.

change).**
