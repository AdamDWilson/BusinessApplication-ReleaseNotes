Security is a key concern for applications and it becomes more paramount for an
external facing application like Dynamics 365 Portal.

In this release we are providing the following capabilities:

1.  IP Filtering:

    -   A key ask mainly from government customers is the ability to white-list
        certain IPâ€™s, so that their Portal can be accessed from their internal
        locations. Customers can now configure IP filtering rules for their
        portal to lock down portals for their users only

2.  DOS prevention

    -   As portals can be accessed without authentication, portals are
        vulnerable to DOS attacks. Customers can now configure DOS prevention
        rules to block access to portals based on usage patterns.
