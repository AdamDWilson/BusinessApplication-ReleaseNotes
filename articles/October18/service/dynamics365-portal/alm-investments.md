This is the [\#3
ask](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=b75ece29-1481-e611-80c1-00155d460f3c)
for Portals in the Ideas website.

Typically, Portal development involves making several configurations and
customizations to achieve the correct portal experience for the end-users. As of
now, Portal Customizers don't have a documented/supported way to migrate these
configurations to a different environment (ex. test / UAT / production). This
feature will provide a fully supported and documented approach to copying portal
configurations from one CRM org to another, thus greatly reducing the time to
manage the Portal configuration lifecycle.
