#  Supportability Investments




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

As part of our investments to improve supportability of Dynamics 365 Portal we
are focusing on better diagnostics and providing customers the ability to
resolve issues on their own using self-service capabilities.

In this release, we are providing the following capabilities:

1.  Ability to reset Portal

    -   Customers need to reset the portal for scenarios like changing base URL,
        moving from one geo/tenant to another etc. This is one of the top
        categories of support cases today amounting to at least 10-15 support
        cases every month. As part of this feature customers would be able to
        reset their portals themselves from Portal Admin center without the need
        to call CSS

2.  Improving Portal diagnostics

    -   This feature looks at customer configurations and highlights potential
        issues and their possible solutions This information is available to CSS
        in the Unify portal, to empower them to close support cases faster. For
        issues that can be fixed automatically, appropriate auto-heal mechanisms
        are provided.

>   *Phase 2: Customers can use the self-service diagnostic tool to identify
>   potential issues and their mitigation*

-   In the Portal Administration center, we are providing contextual links to
    portal documentation and FAQs so that customers can solve problems
    themselves without reaching out to support.
