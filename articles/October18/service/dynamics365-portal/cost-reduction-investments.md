#  Cost Reduction Investments




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

To reduce the COGS for Portals we are taking the following actions:

1.  Automating and speeding up the clean-up of unused resources in
    Pre-production environments

2.  Cleaning up suspended trials earlier than the current 90-day retention
    policy (Need Jean's approval)

3.  Lowering SKUâ€™s (Premium Web app SKU to Basic SKU) for TSP, non-production
    portals in MSIT tenant and testing resources created in production
    environments.

4.  Run a PoC to understand if the DR node can be at a lower SKU level than the
    active node to reduce overall cogs of a portal.
