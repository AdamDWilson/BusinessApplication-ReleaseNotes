#  Multi-resource scheduling


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Multi-resource scheduling allows for multiple resources to be scheduled against
a single work order. This has been an incredibly common ask from customers who
have complex work orders requiring more than a single resource to complete the
work. The infrastructure for multi-resource scheduling was laid by URS in the
Spring Wave and is now being leveraged by Field Service starting with the Fall
Wave.
