#  Entitlement management


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Field Service has extended the current entitlement functionality enabled in the
Customer Service application for its relevant scenarios. This allows for levels
of support to which a customer is entitled to be specified in the field service
context. Example entitlements include accounts, contacts, products, work orders
and work order performance metrics.
