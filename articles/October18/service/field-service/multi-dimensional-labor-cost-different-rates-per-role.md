#  Multi-dimensional labor cost (different rates per role)


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Field service organizations have a strong need to understand labor cost. Field
service technicians are the greatest assets for most of these organizations with
each organization maintaining different requirements for billing rates, fees and
calculating the breakdown of labor costs, equipment, and material cost. This
feature brings the notion of resource-based cost rates and bill-rates to the
Field Service application, allowing for any attribute of a resource, out-of-box
or custom, to act as a pricing dimension and log appropriately priced actuals
for cost and revenue on a work order.
