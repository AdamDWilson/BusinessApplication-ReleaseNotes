#  Background Location Sharing


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Our mobile application now allows for a technician to share his or her current
location, which will result in a location data stream getting sent to Dynamics
365 for Field Service that surfaces the technician’s location on the schedule
board and allows for events to be triggered based on a technician’s current
location. For example, when a technician arrives on site, a push notification
can be sent to the technician to remind the technician to update his or her
status. This will also open scenarios where we can detect that a technician is
going to be late to a work order based on his or her current location and
consequently re-assign the work order to another technician nearby.
