#  Enable More Objectives 


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

-   Support preferred resources as an objective: businesses will be able to
    define preferred resources for requirements and the optimizer will assign
    bookings to preferred resources first while meeting other constraints and
    objectives

-   Support best/least matching skills as an objective: different business have
    different goals for utilizing the skills of resources. With best matching
    skills, businesses can better meet SLA and customer satisfaction, while
    balancing cost and efficiency with lower matching skills.
