#  What if analysis statistic


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

RSO administrators can leverage simulation runs to adjust optimization scope
(include/exclude more resources), objectives (re-order rankings of objectives),
and other parameters to understand what optimization results look like before
locking down the recurring schedule. Additionally, with an analytic statistic,
administrators can better evaluate optimization and compare simulation runs
versus existing bookings.
