#  Single Resource Optimization


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Single resource optimization provides a quick and simple way to re-optimize a
selected resource to ensure that resource still has an optimal route after some
schedule change happens during the day. For example, a resource may have
overlapping bookings after getting assigned an emergency work order in the
middle of day or may not able to make it in time for a booking due to traffic.
