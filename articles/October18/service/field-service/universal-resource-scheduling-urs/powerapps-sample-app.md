#  PowerApps Sample App


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

We are providing an out-of-the-box PowerApps sample app for URS that can
interact with the resource availability search API and pass back information to
create a booking.

Customers are looking to build all sorts of Scheduling Apps such as customer
self-scheduling apps and “greeter apps.” Offering a URS PowerApps sample app
will allow Dynamics 365 CE customers to remain in the Dynamics ecosystem while
using URS as their scheduling solution, instead of having to explore other
scheduling options. It allows a way to query real-time availability based on all
the customers' requirements and then pass back in the booking info when a
booking is created. This sample app is targeted towards our customers who want
to schedule resources with an interface outside of Dynamics 365 CE.
