#  Self Service Scheduling API's


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

URSâ€™s self-service scheduling APIs ultimately allow organizations to embed a
scheduling widget on their own web application, enabling their customers to
search for availability and book appointments. While we have goals of building
the widget itself, the primary focus is to unleash the API's to our partner and
customer the ecosystem, allowing them to build their own visuals.
