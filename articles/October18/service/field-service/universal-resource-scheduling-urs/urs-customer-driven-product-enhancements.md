#  URS Customer-Driven Product Enhancements


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

-   For onsite bookings, the scheduling of pools is now supported, accounting
    for the fact that the calculation of travel time is more nuanced.

-   Extensibility hooks on the schedule board to support a simpler resource
    request flow, with an emphasis on the resource request flow for the Project
    Service application.

-   When inserting a booking between two bookings or re-assigning a booking to
    another resource, the travel time of all associated bookings will properly
    be recalculated.

-   Multi-Resource Scheduling, Crew Scheduling, and Pool scheduling are major
    new feature sets being introduced in Calcium. There will be market feedback
    and scenario completion we will be addressing after these features ship.
