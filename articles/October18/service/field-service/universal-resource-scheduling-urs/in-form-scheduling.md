#  In-Form Scheduling


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Today we have a compelling capability around searching for and creating bookings
with a flexible UI. However, in some cases, the full power of resource
scheduling may not be needed for a casual user who is not a dispatcher or
resource manager. A customer service representative on the phone with a customer
may simply want a list of the top 3 bookings to choose from, while remaining in
the context of their flow, instead of having to pop out a schedule board.
In-form scheduling includes a lightweight widget where the user can select from
the top options in a simple list or calendar view.
