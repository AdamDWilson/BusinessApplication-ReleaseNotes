#  Extensible Resource Availability


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

As part of the Schedule Assistant search, customers can now decide if they want to override the availability of a resource before the search results are returned.
For example, customers with different business closures for different
organizational units can query a table that contains organizational units and
the days they are closed, subsequently removing resource availability during the hours of business closure. 
[INTERNAL] Big name customers and prospects like Best Buy, Centrica, Sonova,
Safetykleen, Silverchain, and many financial services companies have scenarios
which would be unblocked. [/INTERNAL]
