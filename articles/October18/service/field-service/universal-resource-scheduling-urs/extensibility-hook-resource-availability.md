#  Extensibility Hook for Resource Availability


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

After the Schedule Assistant API runs and the results are rendered, customers
can now decide if they want to override the available work hours of a resource.
For example, customers with different business closures for different
organizational units can query a table that contains organizational units and
the days they are closed, subsequently marking the desired hours of resources
that are a part of that organizational unit as “non-working hours” to remove
them from the results.

[INTERNAL] Big name customers and prospects like Best Buy, Centrica, Sonova,
Safetykleen, Silverchain, and many financial services companies have scenarios
which would be unblocked. [/INTERNAL]
