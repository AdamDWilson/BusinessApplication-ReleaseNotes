Key Investment Areas:

1.  Partner Enablement (aka get entities into CDS and syncing back into Core)

    1.  Key Customer: Chemonics for 5/7 – Target is to show end-to-end working
        on 12 entities

    2.  Start work for compensation

    3.  Start work for benefit

    4.  Start work for payroll as part of the F&O integration

2.  Table Stake areas we are just missing – Maturing our overall Core offering

    1.  Benefits – We need to build at least the bare bones employee experience
        since most companies will not want to pay for a different benefits
        provider, a lot of HCMs include this. The partner enablement is to allow
        for vertical or regional offerings that we will never tackle

    2.  Leave & Absence  - We have been delivering in this space, again we are
        doing what’s equivalent to a walk to get mid market customers a
        solution, but verticalized solutions will come through partnership.

    3.  In both of the above areas the work is really around developing the data
        model so that we have a good enough understanding of what these
        experiences need and what other 3rd party vendors would need to synch in
        to make this work

3.  Better Integration across the suite

    1.  Attract – Job creation, employee transfer, etc.

    2.  Onboarding – End user experience for all administrative and soft
        onboarding should be through our onboarding app experience

4.  Differentiation

    1.  Reporting is the one area we can do better than anyone in the industry
        so it’s the only area where we will invest in differentiation with
        things like Q&A and Insights we can light up a lot of interesting
        scenarios

5.  Experience

    1.  We are hoping that by making some IA and UX changes we can vastly
        improve our offering. This is dependent on the AX platform, so we’re not
        sure exactly what we can do yet. We identified some low hanging fruit
