#  Embed applications wherever you need them


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

PowerApps is integrated in more places so users get the amazing canvas and model
driven application functionality wherever they are – SharePoint, Outlook, Power
BI and Microsoft Teams.

1.  **Custom Forms for SharePoint are more capable** – along with easier style
    options, PowerApps forms for SharePoint support image upload, document
    libraries, rich text editing, cascading dropdowns and parent/child screens.
    Guest users on the site can also use custom forms.

2.  **PowerApps Web Part for SharePoint** – content creators within SharePoint
    can leverage PowerApps within their pages providing richer content for their
    users. (GA – May 14, 2018)

3.  **PowerApps Visual for Power BI generally available –** BI creators are able
    to consume PowerApps within their Power BI Reports in production solutions.

4.  **Canvas apps embedded in model driven applications –** enrich model driven
    applications by bringing data from 3rd party systems using embedded canvas
    applications.
