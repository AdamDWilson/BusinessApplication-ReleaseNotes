#  Consistent consumption experiences across form factors


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Users of PowerApps, Dynamics and ISV apps have a consistent experience wherever
they run their apps:

1.  **A single unified player for apps on mobile devices –** Users on Android
    and iOS can run all their Microsoft, ISV, and custom apps (canvas or model)
    from a single place.

2.  **Canvas apps have uniform web and device experiences –** Users running
    canvas apps on web browsers have all the same capabilities as mobile, such
    as charts, sensors and offline support (canvas) when using modern browsers
    like Edge, Google Chrome & Safari.

3.  **New and improved set of controls –** Dependent option sets and multi
    select option sets are available on all model driven applications. Canvas
    application makers can build amazing experiences with new controls: a rich
    text editor, barcodes, QR code scanner and a Microsoft Stream video player.
    Canvas apps can attach signatures and other files and preview attachments.
    All these controls support different screen sizes.

4.  **Highly performant application experiences -** Users of the PowerApps
    players have improved performance when using apps through the web browser or
    embedded in other applications like SharePoint. Model driven forms load
    within 2 second and all other pages, including grids, load within 4 seconds.
