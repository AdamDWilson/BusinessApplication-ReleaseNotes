#  UCI is the default experience for Dynamics users


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

All new users of Dynamics 365 have the Unified Client Interface (UCI) enabled by
default. UCI is a new metadata driven client interface for model driven
applications including Dynamics 365 apps. UCI provides users a consistent,
accessible and modern user interface across any screen size or device. Existing
users have all the familiar web client capabilities to enable a seamless
transition to UCI:

1.  **Advanced commands available on UCI** - familiar experiences are enabled on
    Unified Client Interface: advanced find, bulk editing, record sharing,
    merging of records, creating email templates and duplicate detection.

2.  **Improved embedding experiences** – ISVs, such as CafeX, can embed their
    experiences into a docked panel on forms providing end users with deeply
    integrated experiences.

3.  **Better user experiences** – model driven applications feature improved
    navigation and appropriate information density. Many entity forms such as
    appointments are enhanced to include rich text editing capability and more
    usable controls like date-time.

4.  **Embedded PowerBI reports in forms –** users can access Power BI reports
    within model driven app forms, enabling relevant information on Accounts,
    Contacts or any other record.
