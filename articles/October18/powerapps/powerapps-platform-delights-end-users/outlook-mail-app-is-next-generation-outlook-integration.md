#  Outlook Mail App is the next generation of Outlook integration


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Users can get deep Outlook and Dynamics 365 integration through the Outlook Mail
App for Dynamics 365. The new Mail App supports all mainline scenarios, is much
more performant and reliable than the past add-in, and works across the desktop,
mobile and web Outlook clients.

1.  **Faster and more reliable** – Mail App is a light weight add-in developed
    using UCI that is significantly faster than the legacy Outlook add-in, so
    users can get to their information quickly and without Outlook crashing.
    Many customers see a 10x performance improvement and significantly reduced
    crashes and hangs for the Outlook integration.

2.  **Long requested productivity improvements available in Mail App** – Users
    can select multiple emails and appointments in Outlook and bulk sync them to
    Dynamics. While creating new records, users will be notified of duplicate
    records and provided the ability to act on these duplicates. Additionally,
    users have a faster and richer search and filter experience in look-ups.

3.  **Enhanced functionality for delegate users** – Delegate users can track
    email and appointments on behalf of others. Users can also perform the set
    regarding action on items in Outlook.
