#  Improved supportability for admins 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 and PowerApps admins no longer need to go to the Office 365 admin
center to escalate their issues to customer support. With the new Help & Support
experience, admins can now diagnose and resolve issues on their own – and,
failing that, open a support ticket in context.

These improvements to the end-to-end support experience reduced the customer
support escalation rate by 20% and doubled the number of escalated issues
resolved on the first day.

1.  **Improved email configuration** – It is much easier for admins to correctly
    configure email syncing for their Common Data Service environments. Admins
    can configure email server-side sync with a simplified wizard experience.
    These improvements have successfully driven down related supports ticket
    volume by 20% (where the average 6 month ago was 300+ / month).

2.  **Built-in access to report production outages** – In the unfortunate
    circumstance when there is an outage, customers can help to identify and
    resolve these outages faster without having to go through customer support.
    From the admin center, customers can report the outage of a key production
    scenario, which will immediately escalate the issue to the engineering team.

3.  **More details up-front and faster resolution** – No customer enjoys the
    inevitable back-and-forth with customer support, answering question after
    question to determine the severity of their issue and route it to the right
    support pod. As customers fill out support tickets from the admin center,
    they are asked additional, targeted questions, depending on the topic. This
    additional context enables support agents to spend less time collecting
    information from customers and more time finding the right solutions to
    their problems.

4.  **Single support front-door for the platform and its apps** – All of the
    improvements in the new Help & Support experience for Dynamics 365 Customer
    Engagement are available to the admins for PowerApps, Microsoft Flow, Common
    Data Service, and Dynamics 365.

5.  **Self-help deflection** – Admins are solving their own issues faster thanks
    to improved, contextual access to self-help articles. After selecting the
    support topic for a new support ticket, admins are presented with a curated
    set of self-help articles & suggestions that they can follow to try and
    resolve their issue on their own.

6.  **In-line diagnostics** – Admins are solving their own issues faster thanks
    to new self-service diagnostic tools. After selecting the support topic for
    a new support ticket and entering their org information, the admin is
    presented with relevant information about their issue such as their
    environment’s provisioning status, application status, and the platform’s
    health. For certain issues, admins can also follow a more guided experience
    to troubleshoot their problem.
