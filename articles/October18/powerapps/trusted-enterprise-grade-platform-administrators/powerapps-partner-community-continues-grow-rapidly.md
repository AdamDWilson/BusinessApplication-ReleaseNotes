#  PowerApps partner community continues to grow rapidly


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The PowerApps application ecosystem is expanding fast as more partners are
delivering platform solutions to customers. Enhancements in app publishing have
made it easier for developers to test and roll-out changes to their
applications. In the new Admin Center, partners can self-identify projects that
they deliver, raising the attach rate to over 60% (nearly triple the rate 6
months ago of 23%).
