#  Ready for the global enterprise 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

As a platform for line-of-business applications, PowerApps has added more
capabilities for central administration and control that modern IT teams require
for enterprise-scale application delivery. The platform also offers an
admin-driven upgrade experience in the case that a customer wants to leverage
the new Common Data Service for Apps capabilities.

1.  **Compliance with EU regulations** – PowerApps and the Common Data Service
    for Apps is fully compliant with the EU’s GDPR regulations and provides
    admins a mechanism to find and remove a user’s resources in support of the
    “right to be forgotten.”

2.  **CDS 1.0 -\> 2.0 upgrade** – Early adopters of the Common Data Service have
    a seamless path to upgrade their applications to leverage the new platform
    capabilities. From the admin center, admins can initiate an in-place upgrade
    of their existing Common Data Service environments. The upgrade experience
    assists admins in contacting and engaging with makers in their company to
    test and validate their applications before completing the upgrade.

3.  **Gateway support for non-default environments** – Enterprises can setup
    gateways that provide connections to sensitive company data on-premise.
    Admins can authorize specific gateways to environments where they control
    who can build apps and flows.

4.  **PowerApps audit logs** – Admins have more visibility over the PowerApps
    adoption and activity within their organization. Records of all admin and
    maker activities are available for admins to view in the Office 365 Security
    and Compliance center.

5.  **Rich mobile management for IT Admins** – IT Admins have an expanded
    ability to manage the PowerApps player on mobile devices: Intune on Android
    and iOS, and BlackBerry on iOS.
