#  Unified administration


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Earlier this summer we announced the launch of the new Business Application
Platform Admin Center, which unifies the administration experiences and delivers
a single, reliable portal to manage users, storage capacity, environments, and
application deployments.

The improved usability and accessibility of this admin center has raised the
overall admin NPS up to 20 (up from -12% in Feb 2018):

1.  **Single Dynamics Admin Settings –** Admins no longer need to switch between
    the Dynamics 365 Admin Center and the in-app Admin Settings experience to
    properly setup their environment. Admins and partners can configure all
    environment settings from the admin center.

2.  **Unified Environment Management** – Admins have a single view of all
    environments deployed on the Common Data Service for Apps across their
    organization. From the admin center, admins can fully provision and manage
    all Common Data Service environments.

3.  **Unified Environment Administration –** key Administrator experiences are
    unified across PowerApps, Microsoft Flow, Common Data Service for Apps and
    Dynamics 365. This includes App Usage Reports, Gateway Management, Data Loss
    Prevention (DLP) Configuration, Dynamics 365 App Lifecycle, Organization
    Insights and Trails.

4.  **All Admin experiences meet the accessibility compliance standard of Grade
    C**.
