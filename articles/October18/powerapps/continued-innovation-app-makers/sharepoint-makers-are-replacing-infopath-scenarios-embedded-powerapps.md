#  SharePoint makers are replacing InfoPath scenarios with embedded PowerApps 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The SharePoint community has fully embraced PowerApps as the de facto solution
for customizing and extending their experience. The number of makers customizing
SharePoint forms has tripled in the last six months, thanks to ongoing
advancements in the ease of creation and capabilities of embedded apps. These
makers are delivering production solutions that are delighting their end-users.

**Easier, more cohesive canvas authoring experience boosts maker success rates**

1.  Easier to configure fields and cascading dropdowns in a canvas form

2.  Simplified gallery sort and filter, and form item binding without formulas

3.  Cohesive authoring of Flows in context of canvas apps

4.  Easier to add and manage assets like connections, data, and media

5.  Ability to view data and fields for connected tables, collections and
    variables in context

**Build apps that feel like they belong in SharePoint**

1.  Set custom sizes and flex gracefully to feel more at home on the web

2.  Post documents to doc libraries and retrieve them on demand

3.  Make apps that look and feel more like SharePoint thanks to an improved
    default theme

4.  Share with guest users of SharePoint lists

**Performance gains for end users (and authors too)**

1.  Embedded forms load fast and deliver data near-instantly at runtime

2.  PowerApps Studio loads custom forms faster for quick editing
