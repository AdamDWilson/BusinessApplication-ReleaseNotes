#  Access makers are bringing key workloads to the Common Data Service


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Customers long depended on tools like Access for standalone, low-code business
applications at the departmental level. This rich Office community is now
building both canvas and model-driven PowerApps and storing their data in the
Common Data Service for Apps.

**Easier to work with Common Data Service for Apps data and schema**

1.  In-line schema editing while building both canvas and model-driven apps
    reduces the clicks and time to create applications.

2.  Act on Common Data Service for Apps data events more easily with in-line
    Flow creation and Functions (Blue Ridge).

3.  Improved data integration experience for importing data to Common Data
    Service (PQ).

**More powerful canvas apps built on Common Data Service for Apps**

1.  Build canvas apps over large Common Data Service data sets with improved
    relationships and delegation, so that filtering and joins happen on the
    server.

2.  Create business rules for validation and defaulting honored in the Canvas
    runtime.

**More intuitive experience for creating model-driven apps**

1.  Entity form designer has been improved with an easier and more cohesive
    experience, including the ability to preview changes before publishing.

2.  Improved experience for building app modules and configuring model-driven
    app navigation, including the ability to edit model-driven assets by deep
    link.

3.  Ability to manage lists of model-driven components directly from PowerApps
    (solution explorer is still available as a secondary/advanced link).

**Improved onboarding and assistance**

1.  Both canvas and model-driven apps are easier to share, including in-line
    access management for app dependencies (with more sophisticated role-based
    security as needed).

2.  Improved samples and onboarding experience, including landing pages and
    community topics for specific audiences backed by targeted email engagement.

3.  In-line canvas studio suggestions for improving delegation, performance and
    debugging.

4.  In-line information about premium features help customers understand what
    licenses will be required for their apps.
