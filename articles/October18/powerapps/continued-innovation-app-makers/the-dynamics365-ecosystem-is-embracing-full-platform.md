#  The Dynamics 365 ecosystem is embracing the “full platform”


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 ISVs, partners, and customers are taking advantage of the full
capabilities of PowerApps – including canvas apps and flows – to deliver more
valuable solutions. Customers are embracing the increased quality of partner
solutions as analysis and testing tools improve.

**Bring 200+ data sources and rich, low-code customization to model-driven
forms**

1.  Embed canvas apps into model-driven forms and pass context to them, like
    particular records or grids, just like Power BI embedding.

2.  Richly customize model-driven app UI without code and leverage more than
    200+ data connectors by embedding canvas apps.

**Package canvas apps, flows, and model-driven apps together in a solution**

1.  Makers, ISVs and Partners can package flows, canvas apps and model-driven
    assets together into a single solution.

2.  Admins, ISVs and Partners can distribute composite solutions and manage
    lifecycle across environments, as well as perform snapshots and backups of
    production environments.

**Build and buy model-driven apps of higher quality with the new Solution
Analyzer**

1.  See a scorecard of model-driven app health and top risks with tips for
    improvement – and hold partners accountable before accepting a solution.

2.  Schedule and run functional tests for model-driven apps to ensure they stay
    healthy, and easily access results in your own environment/data store.

3.  Partners, including the MCS Global Delivery teams, are continuously
    validating their solutions leading to higher quality and less churn.
