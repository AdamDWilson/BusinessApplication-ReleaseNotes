#  Load Balancing the on-premises data gateway traffic




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

>   We plan on expanding the on-premises data gateways clustering capabilities
>   to allow admins to load balance their gateways traffic across some or all
>   gateways in a given cluster. This will ensure better utilization of the
>   gateway resources and improved performance.
