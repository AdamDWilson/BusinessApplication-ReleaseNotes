#  Power Query becomes more powerful and smarter (copied in PR)


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

>   Power Query has been dramatically enhanced with market-leading *Smart Data
>   Preparation* experiences, including the ability to extract data from
>   semi-structured sources like PDF files and HTML pages, fuzzy matching
>   algorithms to rationalize and normalize data based on similarity patterns
>   and data profiling capabilities to easily identify errors and outliers as
>   part of the Data Preparation workload in the Power Query Editor.

>   Microsoft is leveraging its leadership in the Artificial Intelligence field,
>   based on years of investment in several projects within Microsoft Research,
>   and surfacing these Smart Data Preparation capabilities in Power Query,
>   making them easily accessible to millions of business users across different
>   Microsoft products and services (Excel, Power BI, CDS for Apps, CDS for
>   Analytics and Flow),

>   In addition to Smart Data Preparation enhancements, Power Query also
>   includes now built-in capabilities and user experiences around Query
>   Profiling, allowing users to easily understand the execution profile of
>   their queries and self-diagnose issues – what queries were run and why, how
>   long it takes to get data from external sources, what queries didn't get
>   pushed down to underlying sources, and more.

>   Intellisense support for the M language editing experiences (Advanced Query
>   Editor, Add Custom Column and Formula Bar) has been added to the Power Query
>   Editor, making users more successful in editing their M code directly, being
>   able to easily find errors, discover M library functions and understand what
>   parameters are needed, etc. M Intellisense support was the most requested
>   feature from intermediate-to-advanced Power Query users in the last couple
>   of years and was at the top of the feature asks for Power Query in the Power
>   BI & Excel Feature Suggestions forums.

>   In addition to new core capabilities within Power Query, Microsoft has also
>   extended the range of products and services that leverage Power Query. Over
>   the past six months, new integrations of Power Query Online have been added
>   to Microsoft Flow and Azure Data Factory.

>   Microsoft Flow now allows users to “Get Rows using Power Query” which
>   enables data filtering & mashup as part of the “Get Rows” action on specific
>   connectors, such as SQL Server.

>   Azure Data Factory integration with Power Query Online allows ETL developers
>   to leverage Power Query Online’s data connectors & data transformations UX
>   in order to define Data Flows as part of their ADF projects.

>   Last but certainly not least, a new Power Query Community Website was
>   launched recently, which includes lots of Power Query technology overview
>   and deep dive articles, as well as forums, UserVoice and community-driven
>   content (blog posts, webinars, etc.), This new community focuses on the core
>   Power Query technology aspects and complements the previously existing
>   product-based resources (Excel, Power BI, PowerApps, etc.) which cover
>   specific Power Query integrations.
