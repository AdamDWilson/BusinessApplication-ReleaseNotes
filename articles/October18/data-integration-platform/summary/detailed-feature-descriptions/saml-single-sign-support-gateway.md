#  SAML Single Sign On support in the gateway


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

>   Last year we added Kerberos single sign-on support to the gateway for
>   multiple sources including SQL Server, SAP Hana and Teradata.

>   This semester we plan to continue investments in single sign-on support by
>   adding support to SAML based single sign-on scenarios for supported data
>   sources.
