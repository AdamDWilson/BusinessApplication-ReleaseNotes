#  Custom Connectors support in on-premises data gateway


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

>   As mentioned earlier in this document, in April, Microsoft released the
>   first Custom Connectors in Power BI, leveraging the powerful capabilities of
>   the M language to allow partners to write their own connectors and
>   distribute them to every Power BI user.

>   This semester we intend to extend the custom connectors support to the
>   on-premises data gateway as well. This will enable users of custom
>   connectors to have their reports built with custom connectors stay up to
>   date on the Power BI service by refreshing the data through the on-premises
>   data gateway.
