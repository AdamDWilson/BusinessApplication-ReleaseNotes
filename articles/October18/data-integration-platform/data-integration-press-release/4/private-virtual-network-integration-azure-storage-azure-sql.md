#  Private Virtual Network integration with Azure Storage and Azure SQL


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

>   For many of our customers moving their business-critical data to the cloud,
>   data breaches remain a top concern. Most customers want to limit access to
>   their critical storage resources to only their private environments, i.e.
>   their Azure Virtual Networks and on-premises.

>   Azure Storage (Blob) and Azure SQL introduced Virtual Network integration
>   support to allow customers to secure their critical storage service
>   resources to only their own virtual networks, providing private connectivity
>   to these resources and fully removing Internet access.

>   Microsoft enhanced the on-premises data gateway to enable bridging
>   connectivity between the private virtual network of a customerâ€™s Azure
>   Storage and Azure SQL, and the multi-tenant Power BI Service, and Common
>   Data Service for Analytics. The customer remains in full control, as they
>   install and configure the data gateway to run within their private virtual
>   network and can tightly manage access control of these data gateway
>   connections to users and security groups in their AAD tenant.
