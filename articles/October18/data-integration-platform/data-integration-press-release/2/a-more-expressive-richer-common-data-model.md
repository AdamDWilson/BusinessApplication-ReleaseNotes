#  A more expressive, richer Common Data Model


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Today’s customers, both existing and potential, leave digital footprints. Every
web search, tweet, support call, event registration, purchase, or interaction
with a connected product or digitally-intermediated service provides clues to
the intent, interests, and demographics of that person. One of the key areas of
Common Data Model enhancements are the **unified representation of profile
enrichments** based on high volume observations (web searches, social media
activity, product telemetry), derived interests and propensities, and associated
metadata such as certainty, and data lineage.

Observational data is rationalized through algorithms into new summarized schema
for preferences, and inferences on known entities such as Contact, which cleanly
stages analytical processing, and **makes refined data simple to use/act on by
business applications**. Packaged as well as custom line-of-business apps and
analytical solutions can leverage the same entities for data sharing, and
thereby support specific needs and business requirements.

Data stored in the Common Data Service for Applications **integrates easily and
automatically **with the** **Common Data Service for Analytics for customers who
use both services, with intelligence flowing back into the Common Data Service
for Applications as enriched entities and analytical calculation results.
You can start from enterprise and transactional data you already own (such
as leads, campaign information, and previous customer purchases) and
combine it with data from other sources (such as weblogs or product telemetry)
to **get a unified picture and synthesize new insights**. This sharing of data
and insights means you can quickly implement new business processes, analytical
solutions, and gain a true 360-degree view into your business operations easily
without complexity.

Microsoft has been **collaborating with an ecosystem of ISVs** who help
organizations digitally transform their business processes by creating industry
extensions to increase reach and flexibility of the Common Data Model (CDM).
Examples include:

-   **Adobe** is collaborating with Microsoft on CDM in multiple areas,
    including the unified representation of profile enrichments and a unified
    customer profile, to facilitate smooth **interoperability** spanning
    services and user experiences, leveraging underneath Microsoft’s CDM and
    Adobe’s XDM.

-   **Dun & Bradstreet** is extending the CDM with the BusinessProfile entity
    providing commercial data, and insights about businesses.

Because of these efforts over the past six months, the Common Data Model has
grown in breadth, depth, and flexibility, to cover a diversity of data,
processes, and analytics:

-   **Entity schemas to support a full range of business processes** across
    sales, services, marketing, operations, finance, talent, and commerce.

-   **Industry extension for specialized verticals**, in collaboration with
    partners in Retail, Financial Analytics, Education, and others.

-   Creation of **unified master records** including merging with reference data
    such as company profiles. Subsequent **enrichment of profiles**, supporting
    the combination of transactional and observational data (such as customer
    interests, purchase intent, and demographics) for a single unified view of
    the Customer, People, and Product entities at the core of a company’s
    business processes

-   Results of **analytical calculations and machine learning** (such as
    sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, product recommendations, invoice
    aging) and making them readily available for business applications.

-   **Data tagging**, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
