#  Built-in automatic support for the Common Data Model 


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Power Query data integration experiences, data integration templates, CDS for
Applications and for Analytics implement the Common Data Model. A critical part
of the Common Data Model, and the suite of products and experiences it supports,
is its extensibility. To ensure our customers and partners can build the
applications and represent the specialized data they need, we continue to invest
in improved built-in support of the extensibility points in the Fall release:

-   **Finer grained CDM Modules for CDS for Applications** to simplify reusing
    common schema by applications.

-   **Published updates** to the Common Data Model repository automatically
    appear within the Power Query entity mapping experiences.

-   **Custom extensions** to the Common Data Model can jumpstart solution
    packages for the Common Data Service for Applications. They also surface
    within the datapool authoring experiences for the Common Data Service for
    Analytics.

-   **Data Integration Templates** accelerate integrating data into well-known
    Common Data Model entity shapes from common line-of-business applications
    and SaaS services. For example, the Salesforce template helps customers
    integrate their data into CDS and thereby gain insights into their
    opportunities and sales pipeline. Customers and ISVs can leverage the
    underlying platform to build their own data integration templates and share
    them across CDS instances, as well as customize existing templates to adapt
    them to their needs and re-package them as new templates for reuse.

-   **Power BI applications can be designed to work on top of, and bind to,
    specific Common Data Model entities.** The Common Data Service for Analytics
    platform facilitates a seamless installation experience based on the
    required entities schema dependencies declared by the application.
