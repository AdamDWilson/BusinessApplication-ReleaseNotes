#  2. Easier sharing, unification, and enrichment of data with Common Data Model entities


[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

The open-source **Common Data Model** definition of standard entities has been
enhanced for the **integration of business processes, applications, and profile
enrichment** across sales, services, marketing, operations, finance, talent, and
commerce business functions, as well as core entity profiles for Customers,
Products and People to support observational data enrichment and analysis.



This includes enabling organizations **to enrich their data with high value
sources** from their own enterprise communication (such interactions with their
customers via Microsoft Office 365), website clickstreams, product telemetry,
social network interactions, and partner integration such as Adobe Experience
Cloud (Adobe XDM).

The Common Data Model enables unification of data in a well-known form with
structural and semantic consistency across applications and deployments. There
is a **large and growing collection of solutions that work together
efficiently** when data is stored in the Common Data Model form. This sharing of
data and insights means you can quickly implement new business processes,
analytical solutions, and gain a true 360-degree view into your business
operations without complexity.

Since the initial release in March, the public Common Data Model GitHub
repository **has grown substantially by several hundred well-defined, modular,
and extensible business entities,** including major extensions to support
additional vertical industries with the Common Data Model and Common Data
Services, in close collaboration with strategic partners. The no-code/low-code
data integration, transformation, and enrichment experiences with Power Query
support and implement the Common Data Model.
