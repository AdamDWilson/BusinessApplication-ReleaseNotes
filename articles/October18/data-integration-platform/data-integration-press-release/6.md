#  Ability to share data integration templates within and across tenants 


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

>   **Data Integration Templates** accelerate getting data to the Common Data
>   Services from common third-party systems of records and SaaS services. For
>   example, the **Salesforce template** helps customers integrate their
>   Salesforce data into CDS and gain insights into their opportunities and
>   sales pipeline easily. In addition to Microsoft providing additional data
>   integration templates out-of-the-box, customers and ISVs can leverage the
>   underlying platform to simply build their own new templates and share them
>   across CDS instances, as well as customize existing templates to adapt them
>   to their needs and re-package them as new templates for reuse.

>   Consultants can customize templates, as well as re-package and reuse them
>   across CDS instances without having to repeat the process. Collaboration and
>   distribution in larger enterprise organizations is supported through sharing
>   templates with specific set users or groups.

>   With the help of Common Data Service for Apps role-based access, business
>   users and admins can now assign fine-grained permissions that allows users
>   within their organization to either read, contribute, or own templates. This
>   capability was also extended to data integration projects, as large
>   enterprise organizations often need to structure who can contribute to
>   projects and who can read/use. Multiple users can share projects and
>   templates with permissions defined for their role.

>   Templates are now also easily discoverable in a central marketplace.
>   Customers can create a data integration project by easily browsing the
>   marketplace and obtain the latest templates. Additionally, customers and
>   partners can create custom templates and publish them to the marketplace.
>   Templates can be shared across tenants with the ability to control
>   viewership.
