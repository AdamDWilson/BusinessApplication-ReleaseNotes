#  Azure Media Services Bets on Video AI & Analytics to Deliver Exciting New Capabilities




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

*REDMOND, December 31, 2018* – Today, Microsoft is pleased to announce several
enhancements to the Azure Media Services platform, which powers video
experiences across multiple industries, as well as serving as the video platform
foundation for several large-scale Microsoft service offerings, including
Microsoft Stream, Office 365, Skype, Xbox, Mixer, LinkedIn, and others. These
new media intelligence capabilities use the power of machine learning and
artificial intelligence to extract deep insights from video, audio, and combines
them with audience analytics to help media customers deliver customized content
and content experiences to viewers. In addition, new platform enhancements
provide customers with high availability streaming, lowered streaming costs and
enhanced APIs with improved ease of use.

The Media Services platform is now deeply integrated with Microsoft’s Video
Indexer capabilities to make it the first cloud video intelligence platform to
enable developers to **train the AI engine** to meet their unique industry
needs. Developers can now create unique face, speech, and object recognition
models ­that meet their business and industry objectives. Media Services
provides the core platform of Video AI technologies including the following
additional new features:

-   **Automatic language identification –** Enterprise Users and developers no
    longer need to worry about identifying and setting the language of a video
    on upload. Media Services can automatically detect and set the initial
    language value upon evaluation of the video. This reduces the effort
    required to manage processing of sources that are not in the customers’
    control and could involve multiple languages.

-   **Audio call analytics** – Media services can now be used to extract
    additional insights from audio calls recorded in various scenarios such as
    Enterprise voice systems, call centers, and more. Using the new platform
    feature, you can extract speaker statistics, recognize brands and generate
    keywords from calls. Together, these capabilities help customers to layer
    unique search and call analytics capabilities on top of their archive of
    audio call recordings.

-   **Extract more accurate transcripts for your Industry -** By integrating
    with Custom Speech, Media Services now enables customers to improve the
    accuracy of video transcription. Developers can create focused vocabularies
    that provide a unique constrained set of words to detect for industries like
    finance, healthcare, academics, sciences, legal, and more. This enables
    customers to minimize the amount of manual labor and cleanup required today
    when using the default vocabulary models provided by Microsoft.

-   **Find the people you care about in your videos** – By providing the ability
    to create custom face detection models directly in the Media Services
    platform, customers can now get back metadata about the people they care
    about in their industry, organization, or enterprise. Enterprise users can
    upload their employee image databases, sports teams can provide their team
    rosters, hospitals can identify their staff, and academic institutions can
    identify their students and professors. Developers can further enhance the
    facial recognition capabilities by providing additional data (i.e. images
    and videos) based on the feedback provided by the platform.

-   **Find custom objects in your videos** – Developers can now provide a sample
    set of images to identify a specific object in a video. This makes it
    possible to easily find unique industry specific objects within a video and
    capture the data for later search and retrieval of content, enabling
    scenarios across a wide range of industries including public safety,
    advertising, and enterprise marketing.
