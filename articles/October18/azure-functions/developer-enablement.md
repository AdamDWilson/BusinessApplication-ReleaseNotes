#  Developer enablement 


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

FaaS provides developers with unparalleled productivity benefits. Developers can
get started quickly and economically without having to worry about scale. Some
improvements in the developer productivity include:

-   **More available languages:** With the introduction of Azure Functions V2.0
    and the new process model architecture, developers are now able to implement
    Functions in Java, Python, Go, and Powershell.

-   **Improved “inner loop” developer experience:** With dedicated tooling in
    Visual Studio for Windows and Mac as well as VS code, developers can create,
    run, debug and deploy Azure Functions directly from their favorite IDE.
    Also, tooling for Functions now includes support for locally debugging
    messages sent using Event Grid.

-   **Managed Service Identity (MSI):** Developers can now provide Functions
    with AAD identities so they can securely connect to external services such
    as SQL database, Event Grid and more. With MSI, developers can also store
    application secrets in Azure Key Vault to meet stringent compliance
    requirements.
