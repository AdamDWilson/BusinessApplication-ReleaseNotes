#  Lifecycle Services for VARs


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 Business Central VARs can build, upload, manage, deploy, upgrade and troubleshoot their customizations and ISV add-ons they use through Lifecycle Services (LCS). In addition to lifecycle management, VARs can also use LCS to manage their engagement with customers and ISVs whose solutions they may be using in customer deployments.
