#  Productivity user experience features




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

The web client has received several most common requested features from
customers that drive increased productivity. Examples of such features are:
popping out windows for multiple window workspaces, advanced keyboard shortcuts,
full keyboarding support, resizing of various screen elements, advanced search
expressions, etc. These are all individually small features, but collectively
they bring a substantial increase in day to day productivity of users using
Dynamics 365 Business Central. In this update, many of these features have been
addressed bringing even higher degree of productivity to users in the web
client. This also means that the windows client, will be retired in the future,
as all the productivity features of the web client are replacing it, and in many
ways superseding its abilities.
