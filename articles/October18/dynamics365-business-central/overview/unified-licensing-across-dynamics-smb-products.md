#  Unified licensing across Dynamics SMB products


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

All license payments that are handled today through DPL (Dynamics Price List)
will be transitioning to Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) licensing system.
Dynamics 365 Business Central customers will only be able to purchase licenses
from partners on the CSP system, whether they are on premises or in the cloud.
Dynamics NAV customers upgrading to Dynamics 365 Business Central, into the
cloud or on premises, will be paying their licenses through CSP. Existing
Dynamics NAV customers will continue to pay their BREP (Business Renewal
Enhancement Plan) through CSP licenses of Business Central, in equivalent
amounts to what they pay today. The same is true for Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL
customers.

This effectively means that all supported Dynamics SMB customers become Dynamics
365 Business Central customers on CSP subscription, with rights to run their
Dynamics NAV, Dynamics GP, and Dynamics SL products on premises under the same
license.
