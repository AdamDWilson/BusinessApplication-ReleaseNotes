#  Dynamics NAV transitions to Dynamics 365 Business Central on-premises


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Since Dynamics NAV and Dynamics 365 Business Central share the same code base,
the transition for customers running Dynamics NAV to Dynamics 365 Business
Central is as seamless as just another Dynamics NAV upgrade. Upon upgrading,
they will receive the new, refreshed, and highly productive user experience of
Dynamics 365 Business Central, and the name of their application with change
from Dynamics NAV to Dynamics 365 Business Central. (See licensing in the next
section).

Partners are still able to code customize the customer installations on
premises, even under Dynamics 365 Business Central. However, when they do that,
they will receive warnings that their solution has become disconnected from the
cloud and the intelligent edge. That is, their path to the cloud is disconnected
until they refactor their customizations and add-ons into an extension. Upon
doing so, Dynamics 365 Business Central will let them know they are again
connected to the cloud and the Intelligent Edge. Microsoft will continue to
support on-premises code customizations; however, we highly recommend that
partners refactor their apps and customizations into extensions to benefit from
continuous updates and the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge.
