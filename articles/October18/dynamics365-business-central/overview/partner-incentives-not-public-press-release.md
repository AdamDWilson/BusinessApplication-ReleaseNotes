#  Partner incentives (not a public press release)


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Under the unified licensing model, partners will be rewarded based on how close
they follow Microsoft cloud strategy and what actions they take with their
existing and new customers.

1.  **Unsupported versions** – for partners that have customers on unsupported
    versions we will create strong incentives to move them. E.g. we will stop
    their BREP payments within 12 months of Business Central fall release. One
    could argue these partners have not earned their BREP. They have not
    provided the maintenance support for their customers.

2.  **Not current** – for partners that have customers that are not on the
    latest version of Business Central CSP on prem but are within supported
    versions. E.g. we will continue BREP payments for 12 months, after which we
    will stop them, forcing the partners to move to the current version of
    Business Central.

3.  **Current but not cloud ready** – for partners that have customers that are
    current on Business Central CSP on prem but are not on extensions. They are
    not cloud ready. We will not touch their CSP margins. For now. Maybe later.
    Maybe not.

4.  **Cloud ready partners** – for partners that are current and have converted
    their customers to extensions. They are cloud ready. E.g. we will give an
    additional 10% of margin on CSP in the next two years.

Customers will receive clear guidance through the product about their cloud
readiness and what they need to do to become cloud ready.
