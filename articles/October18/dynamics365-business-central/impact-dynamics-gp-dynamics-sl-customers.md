#  Impact on Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL customers


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

All Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL customers are already Dynamics 365 Business Central customers on CSP, since all BREP maintenance payments are transitioning to Dynamics 365 Business Central CSP licenses allowing the customers to run and get updates to Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL. We welcome these customers running their workloads on Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL to Dynamics 365 Business Central. This is done through the same Intelligent Cloud / Intelligent Edge scenarios as for Business Central on-premises. Each Dynamics GP or Dynamics SL tenant will have a Business Central cloud tenant they can synchronize their data to. When they use this, we invoke our Intelligent Cloud scenarios of Machine Learning, Power BI, Flow, and others to drive suggested actions. This helps the customer understand further the value of Business Central, and over time, while Microsoft continues to support Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL, these customers can choose when they want to transition to Dynamics 365 Business Central, as a perfect match for their businesses.  

Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL will continue to receive product improvements and updates, but the most benefit to these customers comes from upgrading to Dynamics 365 Business Central. There are migration tools available within Dynamics 365 Business Central and AppSource, and also partners that specialize in upgrading Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL customers to Dynamics 365 Business Central. You can find these partners and further information at https://aka.ms/ReadyToGo.
