#  Unified licensing across Dynamics SMB products


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

All license payments that are handled today through the Dynamics Price List will be transitioning to the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) licensing system. Dynamics 365 Business Central customers can only purchase licenses from partners on the CSP system, whether they are on premises or in the cloud. Dynamics NAV customers upgrading to Dynamics 365 Business Central, into the cloud or on premises, will be paying their licenses through CSP. Existing Dynamics NAV customers continue to pay their BREP (Business Renewal Enhancement Plan) through their new CSP licenses for Business Central, in equivalent amounts to what they pay today. The same is true for Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL customers.  

This effectively means that all supported Dynamics SMB customers become Dynamics 365 Business Central customers on CSP subscription, with rights to run their Dynamics NAV, Dynamics GP, and Dynamics SL products on premises under the same license.
