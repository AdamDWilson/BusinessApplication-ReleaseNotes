#  Business Central – October 2018
With the October 2018 release, Dynamics 365 Business Central is available in the cloud, on premises, and in hybrid deployments. Pick your flavor of Business Central, or use your existing on-premises solution of Dynamics GP, Dynamics NAV, or Dynamics SL and connect to the cloud through Business Central.  

Business Central partners get a portal to facilitate their interactions with customers and to manage the lifecycle of their applications and customizations – Lifecycle Services (LCS). Business users get a further streamlined and refreshed user experience with many productivity improvements, facilitating heavy transactional users. The service is also going through a hardening process, with much improved resiliency, robustness and performance across the application.

## Resilient and robust service
With the scale at which the Business Central service is run, we have made significant investments into the robustness and resilience of the service. We have ensured that all service components are hardened to maximize the mean time to failure (MTTF), even in varying and unpredictable conditions. At the same time, we have ensured that the service is resilient in the case of failures so that it can recover quickly and minimize or eliminate the disruption to customers by minimizing the mean time to recovery (MTTR). The result is high availability so customers have a consistent and performant experience for their key business scenarios.  

## High productivity user experience
With this release, business users get further improvements to the modern and refreshed user experience. Card pages (such as the customer card) also got a refresh, completing the visual refresh of all the application areas, with further refinements across the application.  

The refresh does not stop at a visual refresh – the application experiences are adjusted, simplified, and improved further, and core client capabilities are significantly improved.  

## Lifecycle Services
Business Central partners manage the lifecycle of embed, add-on, and connect apps, as well as customizations through Lifecycle Services (LCS). Lifecycle Services is the portal for ISVs to engage with VARs and customers, and for VARs to engage with ISVs and customers. here, partners manage implementation projects, whitelisting add-ons, and full lifecycle management of ISV solutions and VAR customizations, including live site troubleshooting.  

## Dynamics SMB product unification
With the October '18 release, all SMB products get unified under the Business Central licensing model.  

Business Central itself gets an on-premises deployment option that serves as a successor to Dynamics NAV. In other words, rather than a new version number for Dynamics NAV, customers can get Business Central on premises. The experience for partners and customers on premises is no different from the familiar Dynamics NAV upgrades, except for the change in name and licensing model. This is a convergence point for Dynamics SMB products, from which point forward they are all considered customers of Business Central, in the cloud or on premises, even if they are running differently branded products such as Dynamics SL, Dynamics GP, and older versions of Dynamics NAV.
