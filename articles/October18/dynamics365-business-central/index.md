#  Business Central – October 2018
This fall is an important moment for the broader Dynamics SMB partner and
customer community. All products get unified under the same licensing model, on
premises and in the cloud. Dynamics 365 Business Central partners get a portal
to facilitate their interactions with customers and to manage the lifecycle of
their applications and customizations – Lifecycle Services (LCS). Business users
get a further streamlined and refreshed user experience with many productivity
improvements, facilitating heavy transactional users. The service is also going
through a hardening process, with much improved resiliency, robustness and
performance across the application.

## Resilient and robust service
With the scale at which the Business Central service is run, we have made significant investments into the robustness and resilience of the service. We have ensured that all the service components are hardened to maximize the mean time to failure (MTTF), even in varying and unpredictable conditions, while at the same time we have ensured that the service is resilient in the case of failures so that it can recover quickly and minimize or eliminate the disruption to customers by minimizing the mean time to recovery (MTTR). The result is high availability, offering customers a consistent and performant experience for their key business scenarios.  

## High productivity user experience
Business users will get further improvements to the modern and refreshed user experience. Card pages (such as the customer card) will also get a refresh, completing the visual refresh of all the application areas, with further refinements across the application.  
Furthermore, the UX refresh will not stop at a visual refresh – the application experiences will be adjusted, simplified and improved further, and the core client capabilities will be significantly improved.  

## Lifecycle Services
Business Central ISVs and VARs will receive support for the lifecycle of embed, addon and connect apps, as well as customizations through Lifecycle Services (LCS). Lifecycle Services will be the portal for ISVs to engage with VARs and customers and for VARs to engage with ISVs and customers. It will facilitate implementation projects, whitelisting VARs and ISV add-ons, and full lifecycle management of ISV solutions and VAR customizations, including live site troubleshooting.  

## Dynamics SMB product unification
This fall is the point in time where all the SMB products get unified under the same licensing model of Business Central.  
Business Central itself gets an on-premises deployment which will serve on premises as a successor of Dynamics NAV. In other words, rather than Dynamics NAV 2019, customers will get Business Central on premises. The experience for partners and customers on premises will be no different from the yearly Dynamics NAV upgrades, except for the change in name and licensing model. This is a convergence point for Dynamics SMB products, from which point forward they will be all considered customers of Business Central, in the cloud or on premises, even if they are running legacy products such as Dynamics SL, Dynamics GP, and older versions of Dynamics NAV.
