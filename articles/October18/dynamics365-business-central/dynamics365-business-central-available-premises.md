#  Dynamics 365 Business Central available on premises


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

While Business Central is a cloud-first service, customers that need to run their workloads on premises or on the intelligent edge connected to the cloud can do so. With Business Central, once the customer signs up for the service in
the cloud, they have the option to deploy it locally to their own choice of hardware. While they are running Business Central on their own hardware, the customer will have a tenant in the cloud, and the data from the customer’s hardware will be replicated to the cloud for Intelligent Cloud scenarios. At all times, the customer is informed of their “Cloud Ready” status, so when they’re ready to transition to the cloud completely, it’s a simple step.

Inversely, if the customer decides to take their cloud workload temporarily or permanently from the cloud to on-premises, they can do so. The customer data is always uploaded to the cloud from on premises (customers can opt out if desired), to bring the intelligent cloud capabilities to the Business Central deployments on the intelligent edge. Business Central will be licensed through CSP, at a same price, regardless where the customer (through a partner) deploys their solution.
