#  Lifecycle Services for Business Central
[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 Business Central ISVs can build, upload, manage, deploy, upgrade and troubleshoot their application services and add-ons through Lifecycle Services (LCS). In addition to lifecycle management, LCS will also enable ISVs to engage with other ISVs and VARs and manage their engagement with their ISV solution and common customers.
