#  Lifecycle Services for ISVs


[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 Business Central ISVs receive the ability to build, upload, manage,
deploy, upgrade and troubleshoot their application services and add-ons through
Lifecycle Services (LCS). In addition to lifecycle management, LCS will also
enable ISVs to engage with other ISVs and VARs and manage their engagement with
their ISV solution and common customers.
