#  Productivity user experience features

[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The browser experience has received several commonly requested features from customers that drive increased productivity. Examples of such features are: popping out windows for multiple window workspaces, advanced keyboard shortcuts, full keyboarding support, resizing of various screen elements, and advanced search expressions. These are all individually small features, but collectively they bring a substantial increase in the day-to-day productivity of Business Central users. In this update, many of these features have been addressed bringing even higher degree of productivity to users in the browser.  

<!--This also means that the windows client, will be retired in the future, as all the productivity features of the web client are replacing it, and in many ways superseding its abilities.  -->
