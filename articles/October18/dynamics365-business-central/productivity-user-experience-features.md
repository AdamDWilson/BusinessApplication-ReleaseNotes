#  Productivity user experience features

[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The browser experience has received several commonly requested features from customers that drive increased productivity. Examples of such features are: popping out windows for multiple window workspaces, advanced keyboard shortcuts, full keyboarding support, resizing of various screen elements, and advanced search expressions. These are all individually small features, but collectively they bring a substantial increase in the day-to-day productivity of Business Central users. In this update, many of these features have been addressed bringing even higher degree of productivity to users in the browser.  

<!--This also means that the windows client, will be retired in the future, as all the productivity features of the web client are replacing it, and in many ways superseding its abilities.  -->

## Improvements to search
Productivity increases when people can find what they need, and search is often how people look for things. Therefore we’ve broadened the search scope, improved the logic that the search uses, and made it easier to determine whether the results are relevant. The Search field replaces the Search for Page or Report field, and you can use it to find objects such as pages, reports, but also actions and product documentation, including tooltips that describe individual fields. We’ve also improved the logic behind the search, so that it also looks for synonyms, uses fuzzy search, and so on, so that you no longer need to know the exact name of the thing you want to find. Search results list only one time, and offer abstracts that clarify each item in the result.
