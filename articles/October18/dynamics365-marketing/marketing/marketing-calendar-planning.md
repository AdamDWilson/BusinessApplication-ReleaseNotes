#  Marketing Calendar for planning




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Marketers frequently plan their marketing activities for the entire year and
beyond. Marketing calendars are an essential aspect of modern marketing
execution in that they facilitate planning and alignment across different
departments and teams. An out-of-the-box, comprehensive marketing calendar view
rendering marketing activities chronologically allows marketers and managers to
understand the overview of the marketing planning while being able to drill into
each activity in detail as needed.
