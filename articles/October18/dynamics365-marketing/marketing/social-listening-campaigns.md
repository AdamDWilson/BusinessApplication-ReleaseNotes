#  Social Listening for your campaigns




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Modern Marketing relies on signals from social media for a tighter customer
engagement. Dynamics 365 for Marketing provides social, in-context engagement
KPIs and monitoring functionality that can help organizations improve their
marketing strategies and increase the generation of qualified leads.

Contextual insights for campaign tracking and performance on social media allow
marketers to track the social aspects of their campaigns in-context with the
rest of their marketing initiatives. Marketers can customize such Insights
within the customer journey experience. Dashboard-based social insights on
brands and competitors allow marketers to follow the social signals for the
select brands and engage as needed.
