#  Reusable Content Blocks




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 for Marketing managers frequently want to control the creation flow
and editing capabilities of marketing content in the organization. For example,
in a given email marketing message only the header area can be edited by a
certain group of marketing users. Dynamics 365 for Marketing administrators can
configure security roles for controlled editing capabilities in the content
designer for all supported content types (email, marketing pages, forms, and
others). They can define editable areas in each content type depending on the
security role of the current CRM user.

When creating new marketing material, marketers and other end users often need
to reuse existing content to improve the message alignment and operational
efficiency. Dynamics 365 for Marketing enables the creation and reuse of
dedicated snippets of HTML content (reusable content blocks) in the content
designer editor. This enables Dynamics 365 end users to share reusable content
across different content types in a secure and controlled way.
