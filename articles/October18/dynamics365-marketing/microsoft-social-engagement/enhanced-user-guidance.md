#  Enhanced User Guidance




[!include[banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

Providing in-app guidance right where the users need it helps them get the most
value by quickly getting familiar with how to get around and use the app.
Starting with a product tour in the first-run experience, the in-app guide will
be just a click away at any time to help users get quick guidance on specific
areas of the app.
