#  **Improved Reliability and Support Experience**


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The Azure App Service team has produced a set of capabilities aimed at improving
the reliability of the platform and at providing a superior set of
self-diagnostics and fault prevention tooling. As a leading PaaS service, the
Azure App Service team maintains what approaches a million virtual machines
deployed across the globe. In this period, the team worked hand-in-hand with the
Microsoft support organization and improved the App Service Diagnostics
experience to:

-   **Support early prevention of faults** by providing developers with the
    ability to debug pre-production code directly in the cloud and on any
    platform (Linux, virtual private cloud).

-   **Reduce the need for support calls** by reducing platform faults and
    delivering innovative troubleshooting experiences to help customers more
    easily identify their application errors, quickly deliver root cause
    analysis statements during relevant Azure platform outages that, and better
    deliver how-to documentation when the customer is lost.

-   **Empower Azure support engineers** by providing them with the tools they
    need to quickly identify the root cause of issues reported by customers and
    thus reducing the time it takes to make things right.

**Enterprise Strength**

Azure App Service has been embraced by small startups and Fortune 500 companies
due to its ability to make developers agile. Azure App Service allows for
developer productivity while giving operators and IT principals the right level
of visibility into its inner workings, compliance guarantees and critical
configuration “knobs”. In this period, the team delivered on the following
improvements aimed at enterprise customers:

-   **In depth control of network isolation**. Organizations using Azure App
    Service can now secure access to applications in multi-tenant environments
    as well as in virtual private cloud (App Service Environment instances).
    Large customers can manage resources on a dedicated scale unit that is
    Availability Zone aware and is easy to secure.

-   **Windows Containers support** is now available for customers wanting to
    migrate existing .NET workloads to the cloud while retaining legacy
    dependencies such as COM components or GAC assemblies.

-   **Azure Stack point release.** The Azure App Service team continues to
    deliver on a predictable cadence of making public cloud features promptly
    available on the private cloud.

-   **Managed Service Identity (MSI) support**. MSI support has GA, and it
    enables customers to securely access their back-end resources without the
    need to store back-end secrets in code.
