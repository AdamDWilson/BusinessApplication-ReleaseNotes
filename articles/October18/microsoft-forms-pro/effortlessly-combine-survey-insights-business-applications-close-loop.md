#  Effortlessly combine survey insights with your business applications to close the loop 




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Forms Pro leverages Flow and CDS to help close the loop in feedback management
lifecycle. It integrates well with Microsoft Flow for the following:

-   **Enriches Contact Management based on survey responses**: Forms Pro
    leverages Microsoft Flow to push business relevant information to other
    business applications. For example, ‘Contact’ and other related entities can
    be appended with NPS scores.

-   **Triggers follow up actions in other business applications**: Forms Pro
    enables creation of follow up actions based on survey response analysis.
    Follow up actions may range from sending a follow up survey to invoking an
    activity or relevant actions in the other business applications using
    Microsoft Flow.
