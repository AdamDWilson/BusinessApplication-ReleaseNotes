#  Easily send survey requests to target users at the time or business event of your choice


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Distribute your survey to target users using multitude of channels, whether it
is via email or embedded on your web site or just grab the survey link to use on
a channel of your choice. What’s more, you can also send surveys when a business
event occurs in your application. Forms Pro combines the power of Office 365 and
Microsoft Flow to make distribution a seamless experience.

-   **Surveys through email –** Compose an email using our rich text editor with
    a personalized or anonymous survey link. Quickly send to your Office 365
    users and groups or bring your own contact list.

-   **Surveys embedded in your applications –** Copy a small code snippet from
    Forms Pro and embed it in your website to add the survey to your website.

-   **Surveys using channel of your choice –** Take the survey link and directly
    use it in the channel of your choice to send the survey.

-   **Surveys sent on a business event** – Forms Pro and Microsoft Flow work
    together seamlessly to let you easily send a survey on a business event in
    your applications e.g. you can send a survey when a Case is resolved in your
    Dynamics 365 Customer engagement or any other business application of your
    choice. With Forms Pro’s easy to use Flow templates, configure Microsoft
    Flow with any of the popular business applications & send a survey on
    business events such as case closure, opportunity won, new employee
    on-boarded etc.
