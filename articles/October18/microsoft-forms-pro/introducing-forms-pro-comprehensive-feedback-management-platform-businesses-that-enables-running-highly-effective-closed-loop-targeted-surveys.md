#  Introducing Microsoft Forms Pro – a comprehensive feedback management platform for businesses that enables running highly effective, closed-loop and targeted surveys


[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

**REDMOND, WA – October 1st, 2018** – Today, we are pleased to announce public
preview of a new service for business applications – **Microsoft Forms Pro**, a
new self-service feedback management service from Microsoft.

In today’s competitive landscape, products and services are commoditized.
Acquiring new and retaining existing customers, employees, partners and citizen
affiliations are increasingly determined by their engagement levels. Improving
customer, employee, partner and citizen engagement starts with measuring their
current engagement levels, gathering their feedback and running a closed loop
feedback management process. Microsoft Forms Pro enables businesses and
governments of all sizes to on-board quickly to the survey platform, create
smart surveys, collect and analyze structured and unstructured survey responses,
derive actionable insights and trigger necessary adjustments in the business
applications to help improve engagement levels.
