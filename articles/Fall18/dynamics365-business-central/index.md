# [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] Release Notes Fall 2018
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is a business management solution for small and mid-sized organizations that automates and streamlines business processes and helps you manage your business. Highly adaptable and rich with features, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] enables companies to manage their business, including finance, manufacturing, sales, shipping, project management, services, and more. Companies can easily add functionality that is relevant to the region of operation, and that is customized to support even highly specialized industries.

This fall is an important moment for the broader Dynamics SMB partner and customer community. All products get unified under the same licensing model, on premises and in the cloud. Dynamics 365 Business Central partners get a portal to facilitate their interactions with customers and to manage the lifecycle of their applications and customizations – Lifecycle Services (LCS) support Business Central. Business users get a further streamlined and refreshed user experience with many productivity improvements in the web client, facilitating heavy transactional users. The service is also gone through a hardening process, with much improved resiliency, robustness and performance across the application.  

**Dynamics SMB product unification:** This fall is the point in time where all the SMB products get unified under the same licensing model of Business Central. Business Central itself, gets an on-premises deployment which will serve on premises as a successor of Dynamics NAV. Namely, instead of Dynamics NAV 2019, customers will have Business Central on premises. The experience for partners and customers on premise will be no different from a usual yearly upgrade of Dynamics NAV, except for the name change and licensing model change. This is a convergence point for Dynamics SMB products, from which point forward they will be all considered customers of Business Central, in the cloud or on premise, even if they are running legacy products such as Dynamics SL, Dynamics GP, and older versions of Dynamics NAV.  

**Lifecycle Services:** Business Central ISVs and VARs will receive support for the lifecycle of embed, add-on and connect apps, as well as customizations through Lifecycle Services (LCS). Lifecycle services will be the portal for ISVs to engage with VARs and customers and for VARs to engage with ISVs and customers. It will facilitate implementation projects, whitelisting VARs and ISV add-ons, and full lifecycle management of ISV solutions and VAR customizations, including live site troubleshooting.  

**High productivity user experience:** Business users will get further improvements to the modern and refreshed user experience. Card pages (such as the customer card page) will also get a refresh, completing the visual refresh of all the application areas, with further refinements across the applications. Furthermore, the UX refresh will not stop at visual refresh – the application experiences will be adjusted, simplified and improved further and the core client capabilities will be significantly improved.  

**Resilient and robust service:** With the scale at which the Business Central service is run, we have made significant investments into the robustness and resilience of the service. We have ensured that all the service components are hardened to maximize the mean time to (MTTF), even in varying and unpredictable conditions, while at the same time we have ensured that the service is resilient in the case of failures so that it can recover quickly and minimize or eliminate the disruption to customers by minimizing the mean time to recovery (MTTR). The result is a highly available service, offering customers a consistent and performant experience for their key business scenarios.
