# Social Insights from Social Engagement

In Dynamics 365, you can get powerful social insights by connecting Dynamics 365 to Social Engagement. Social Engagement puts social media at the fingertips of your sales teams, customer service agents, and everyone across the organization. The easy-to-understand widgets provide insights and help you understand what your customers or prospects are saying about your products, brands, and services. 

With Social Insights, you bring social media data directly into Dynamics 365 dashboards and entity forms. [An administrator configures the connection to Social Engagement and add the Social Insights controls to system dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/social-engagement/integrate-social-engagement-dynamics-365). Work with the Social Insights controls to specify what social data you want to see and in what form you want this data to be presented to you. It can be a graph or chart, or some other visual representation of data. You can find a lot of interesting, useful, and easy-to-follow information.

The Social Insights widgets in your Dynamics 365 forms and dashboards provide convenient access to social data right where you work. At any time, you can click on any widget to be taken into Social Engagement to drill down and explore the data further.

The feature will be generally available in June 2018 or later.
