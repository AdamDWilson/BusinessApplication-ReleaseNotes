## Data protection and security
Dynamics 365 delivers industry‑leading security measures and privacy policies to safeguard customer data when using a Microsoft Cloud Service or running Microsoft Dynamics business applications in our customers’ data centers.
The Spring ’18 release includes investments in Dynamics 365 products to address the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) adopted by the European Union (EU).

### General Data Protection Regulation
In May 2018, a European privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes effect. The GDPR imposes rules on companies, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations that offer goods and services to people in the EU, or that collect and analyze data tied to EU residents. The GDPR applies no matter where you are located.

Microsoft has extensive expertise in protecting data, championing privacy, and complying with complex regulations, and currently complies with both EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and EU Model Clauses.

We believe that the GDPR is an important step forward for clarifying and enabling individual privacy rights. We want to help you focus on your core business while efficiently preparing for the GDPR.

###  Resources to manage GDPR compliance for your organization
[Go to the Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Privacy/gdpr/default.aspx), where you’ll find tools and auditing reports to help you manage cloud-data security and compliance for your organization:
-   Use Compliance Manager to get insights into your responsibilities for meeting compliance standards.
-   Get details on how the Microsoft Cloud complies with standards that matter to your organization.
-   [Find resources](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/privacy/gdpr/resources) like webinars, videos, white papers, and [FAQs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Privacy/gdpr/FAQ) about the regulation.

##  Accessibility

Accessibility is a top priority for many organizations, often to meet regulatory requirements, but also because it is an important part of driving productivity through digital transformation.

The Spring ’18 release includes investments that support our commitment to inclusive design in Dynamics 365. Accessibility capabilities are built in so organizations can accelerate digital inclusion and make it easier for users to create and consume content, whether they have disabilities or just don’t have access to a mouse or monitor.
