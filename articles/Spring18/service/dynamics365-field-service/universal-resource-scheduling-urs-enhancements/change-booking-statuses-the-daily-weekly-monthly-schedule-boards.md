#  Change booking statuses from the daily, weekly, and monthly schedule boards




[!include[banner](../../../../includes/banner.md)]

Users can right-click a booking on the hourly schedule board and change the
status of a booking. However, on the multiday schedule boards, bookings are
aggregated from the same requirement and the same status into one block, for
legibility. Users can now change the statuses for multiple bookings at once from
the multiday boards.
