#  Common Data Service for Apps




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

The Common Data Service for Apps is how PowerApps, Office, and the Dynamics
suite of products integrate with a single system of record for business data.
The Common Data Service for Apps is the native system of record for:

-   Dynamics 365 for Sales.

-   Dynamics 365 for Service.

-   Dynamics 365 for Field Service.

-   Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation.

-   Dynamics 365 for Marketing.

-   The Dynamics 365 for Talent family of applications.

-   Standalone IT business apps.

Additionally, the new Data Integrator (powered by Power Query) provides an easy
way to integrate data from Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations with Common
Data Service for Apps data.

Taken together, the Common Data Service for Apps provides a coherent view of a
business across functions and roles in Dynamics 365. For example, you can have a
single customer list, product catalog, or employee directory. The single system
of record acts as the foundation for digital transformation.
