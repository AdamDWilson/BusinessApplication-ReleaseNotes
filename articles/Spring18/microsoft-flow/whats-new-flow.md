# Spring ’18 summary of what’s new in Microsoft Flow



[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

## April ’18 - General Availability

- [Return data to PowerApps from a flow](return-data-powerapps.md) - Build flows that can be called from an app built with PowerApps, and return data back to the app. Use the visual drag-and-drop flow designer to build the logic you need for the app.
- [Access modern approvals in the Common Data Service for Apps](access-modern-approvals-common-data-service-apps.md) - Modern approvals data in Flow is built on the latest version of the Common Data Service for Apps. This means that you can build flows that read the status of the approvals you send or receive with the CDS connector.
- [Find errors in “Apply to each” actions](find-errors-apply-each.md) - Jump directly to errors in loops in the flow run view, even when there are hundreds of items in the loop.
- [Reassign approvals](approval-reassignment.md) - Assign any approval that you receive to another person in your organization, to delegate the approval.
- [See details of flow buttons](see-details-flow.md) - When you run a flow that has been shared with you, see all the actions that the flow uses.
- [United Kingdom region](united-kingdom-region.md) - Create environments to store data in the United Kingdom.
- [New documentation landing page](new-documentation-landing-page.md) - On the documentation landing page, group content by skill level: beginner, intermediate user, or expert.
- [Add multiple records to array inputs](add-multiple-records-array-inputs.md) - Use a list builder to add multiple attachments to an email, for example.
- [Test flows with previous run data](test-flows-previous-run-data.md) - Test your flow with trigger data from previous flow runs by using a Test flow button in the designer.
- [Access flow details with the workflow() expression](access-flow-details-workflow-expression.md) - Access the environment name and flow display name with the workflow() expression.

## May ’18 - General Availability

- [Build and run flows from Excel](build-run-flows-excel.md) - With the new **Flow** button (accessed from the ribbon’s **Data** tab), you can create and trigger automations from Flow on your table data in Excel. Automate data processing or the copying/importing of data.
- [Flows “owned by” SharePoint lists and libraries](sharepoint-lists-libraries.md) - Flows that work with SharePoint lists and libraries can be shared with those lists or libraries. So, instead of being shared with individuals or groups, they’re shared with everyone who has access to the list. As users are added or removed from the list or library, their membership  automatically changes accordingly.
- [GDPR compliance](gdpr-compliance.md) - To support the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), administrators can now submit a request to export or delete all of the data about Flow users.
- [Error details analytics](error-details-analytics.md) - A new embedded report that provides information about all of the errors that happen inside a flow.
- [Share flows with Office 365 groups](share-with-o365-groups.md) - You can make an Office 365 modern group the owner of a flow, and you can shared button flows with Office 365 groups so anyone in the group can run the flow.
- [SharePoint connector improvements](sharepoint-connector-improvements.md) - There are two new SharePoint connector capabilities: trigger flows when items or files are deleted and call any HTTP endpoint that the SharePoint REST API supports.


## May – July ’18 - General Availability

- [Request for sign-off flow built into SharePoint](request-sign-off-flow-built-into-sharepoint.md) - When you select a file or item in SharePoint, you’ll see a new **Request for sign-off** flow. This flow doesn't require any configuration or setup, and sends a sign-off request with a single click.
- [Repair recommendations sent in email for failed flows](repair-recommendations-sent-email-failed-flows.md) - If a flow fails, detailed repair recommendations can be sent to your inbox. These step-by-step recommendations are linked directly to the information you need to fix the most common failures.
- [Customize SharePoint content approvals with Flow](customize-sharepoint-content-approvals-flow.md) - For SharePoint page libraries, site administrators can take advantage of Flow for content approval workflows.
- [Create a business process flow](create-business-process-flow.md) - A business process flow is a new type of stateful, human-interactive flow based on the Common Data Service for Apps. Use these new flows to define a set of stages and steps for people to follow. They can move forward and backward as needed.
- [Business process flow entity customization](business-process-flow-entity-customization.md) - Business process flow entities can appear in the system so that entity record data can be made available in grids, views, charts, and dashboards.

This flow automatically creates tasks for the \@mentioned person in Microsoft To-Do, based on the content of the email.
- [Test your flow by using sample data](test-flow-using-sample-data.md) - Creating a flow might require some trial and error during the development process. Use sample data to test your flow as you build it, so you know that the flow will run as expected.
- [Quick access to help and support](quick-access-help-support.md) - Open support tickets in the context of an issue encountered in Flow, such as when your workflow is failing. Automatically provide Microsoft support engineers with failure details for quicker resolution.
